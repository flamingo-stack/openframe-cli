Defines flag structures and configuration options for the development workflow commands in a Kubernetes development tool.

## Key Components

- **InterceptFlags**: Configuration structure for traffic interception functionality, including port forwarding, namespace targeting, volume mounting, environment file loading, and traffic filtering options
- **ScaffoldFlags**: Configuration structure for service scaffolding, including Docker image specification, port configuration, file synchronization, and cluster management settings  
- **AddGlobalFlags()**: Helper function that registers common command-line flags for verbose output, silent mode, and dry-run execution

## Usage Example

```go
// Create intercept flags for a specific service
interceptFlags := &InterceptFlags{
    Port:      8080,
    Namespace: "development", 
    Global:    false,
    Header:    []string{"x-dev-user: alice"},
    Replace:   true,
}

// Create scaffold flags for new service deployment
scaffoldFlags := &ScaffoldFlags{
    Image:       "my-app:latest",
    Port:        3000,
    Namespace:   "staging",
    SyncLocal:   "./src",
    SyncRemote:  "/app/src",
    ClusterName: "dev-cluster",
}

// Add global flags to a cobra command
cmd := &cobra.Command{Use: "dev"}
AddGlobalFlags(cmd)
```

These structures provide a clean interface for managing complex command-line configurations across different development workflow operations, with support for traffic interception patterns and service deployment scaffolding in Kubernetes environments.
