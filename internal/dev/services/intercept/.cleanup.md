Handles graceful cleanup of Telepresence intercepts when the service receives interrupt signals like Ctrl+C or SIGTERM. Ensures proper teardown of active intercepts and restoration of original Kubernetes namespace state.

## Key Components

- **setupCleanupHandler()** - Configures signal handlers for os.Interrupt and syscall.SIGTERM, spawning a cleanup goroutine when signals are received
- **cleanup()** - Performs the actual cleanup sequence including leaving active intercepts, stopping the Telepresence daemon, and restoring the original namespace
- **Signal handling** - Uses Go's signal package to capture interrupt signals and trigger graceful shutdown

## Usage Example

```go
// Setup cleanup handling during service initialization
service := &Service{
    signalChannel: make(chan os.Signal, 1),
    verbose: true,
}

// Configure signal handlers
service.setupCleanupHandler("my-service")

// The cleanup will automatically trigger on Ctrl+C or SIGTERM
// Cleanup sequence:
// 1. Stop current intercept with 'telepresence leave'  
// 2. Quit telepresence daemon with 'telepresence quit'
// 3. Restore original namespace if changed
// 4. Exit gracefully with status 0
```

The cleanup process uses a 30-second timeout context and provides verbose logging when enabled. It safely handles cases where no intercept is currently active and ensures the Telepresence daemon is properly terminated.
