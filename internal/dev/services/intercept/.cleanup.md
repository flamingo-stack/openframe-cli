Handles graceful cleanup and signal management for the intercept service, ensuring proper teardown of Telepresence connections when the application is interrupted.

## Key Components

- **`setupCleanupHandler(serviceName)`** - Configures signal handling for SIGINT and SIGTERM to trigger cleanup operations
- **`cleanup()`** - Performs comprehensive cleanup including leaving intercepts, stopping Telepresence daemon, and restoring original namespace

## Usage Example

```go
// Initialize service with cleanup handling
service := &Service{
    signalChannel: make(chan os.Signal, 1),
    verbose: true,
}

// Setup cleanup handler for a specific service
service.setupCleanupHandler("my-api-service")

// The cleanup will automatically trigger on Ctrl+C or SIGTERM
// Cleanup process:
// 1. Leave current intercept
// 2. Stop Telepresence daemon
// 3. Restore original namespace
// 4. Exit gracefully
```

The cleanup process runs with a 30-second timeout context and provides verbose logging when enabled. It ensures the Telepresence environment is properly restored to its original state before the application exits.
