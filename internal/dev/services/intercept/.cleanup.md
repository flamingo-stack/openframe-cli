Handles graceful shutdown and cleanup operations for telepresence intercepts, ensuring proper resource cleanup when the service is terminated.

## Key Components

- **setupCleanupHandler()** - Configures signal handlers for SIGINT/SIGTERM to trigger graceful shutdown
- **cleanup()** - Performs complete cleanup sequence including leaving intercepts, stopping telepresence daemon, and restoring original namespace

## Usage Example

```go
// Setup cleanup handling during service initialization
service := &Service{
    signalChannel: make(chan os.Signal, 1),
    verbose: true,
}

// Configure cleanup for a specific service
service.setupCleanupHandler("my-service")

// Cleanup will automatically trigger on Ctrl+C or SIGTERM
// Manual cleanup can also be called
service.cleanup()
```

The cleanup process follows a specific sequence:
1. Leaves the current telepresence intercept
2. Quits the telepresence daemon
3. Restores the original Kubernetes namespace
4. Exits the application gracefully

All operations include a 30-second timeout and provide verbose logging when enabled. The cleanup ensures no dangling telepresence processes or intercepts remain active.
