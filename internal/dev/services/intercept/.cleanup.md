A cleanup handler for the intercept service that manages graceful shutdown and signal handling for Telepresence intercept operations.

## Key Components

### Functions

- **`setupCleanupHandler(serviceName string)`** - Configures signal handling for SIGINT and SIGTERM to trigger graceful cleanup
- **`cleanup()`** - Performs comprehensive cleanup operations including leaving intercepts, stopping daemon, and restoring namespace

## Usage Example

```go
// Initialize service with cleanup handling
service := &Service{
    signalChannel: make(chan os.Signal, 1),
    verbose: true,
}

// Setup cleanup handler for a specific service
service.setupCleanupHandler("my-service")

// The cleanup handler will automatically:
// - Listen for Ctrl+C or SIGTERM signals
// - Leave active Telepresence intercepts
// - Stop the Telepresence daemon
// - Restore original Kubernetes namespace
// - Exit gracefully with status 0
```

The cleanup process includes a 30-second timeout for all operations and provides verbose logging when enabled. Signal handling runs in a separate goroutine to avoid blocking the main service operation.
