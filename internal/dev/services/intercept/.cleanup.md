Provides graceful shutdown handling for Kubernetes service interception, managing cleanup of telepresence connections and namespace restoration when receiving interrupt signals.

## Key Components

- **setupCleanupHandler()** - Configures signal handlers for SIGINT and SIGTERM to trigger graceful cleanup
- **cleanup()** - Performs cleanup operations including leaving intercepts, quitting telepresence daemon, and restoring original namespace

## Usage Example

```go
// Initialize service and setup cleanup handling
service := &Service{
    signalChannel: make(chan os.Signal, 1),
    verbose: true,
}

// Setup cleanup handler for a service
service.setupCleanupHandler("my-api-service")

// Start intercepting... cleanup will automatically run on Ctrl+C or SIGTERM
```

The cleanup process includes:
- Leaving active telepresence intercepts
- Stopping the telepresence daemon
- Restoring the original Kubernetes namespace
- Graceful exit with status messages

All cleanup operations have a 30-second timeout and provide appropriate success/warning messages based on the verbose flag setting.
