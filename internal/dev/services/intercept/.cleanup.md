Handles graceful cleanup and signal management for Telepresence intercept operations, ensuring proper resource cleanup when the service is terminated.

## Key Components

- **setupCleanupHandler()** - Configures signal handling for SIGINT and SIGTERM to trigger graceful shutdown
- **cleanup()** - Performs complete cleanup sequence including leaving intercepts, stopping Telepresence daemon, and restoring original namespace
- **Signal handling** - Monitors interrupt signals in a separate goroutine for responsive cleanup

## Usage Example

```go
// Typically called during service initialization
service := &Service{
    signalChannel: make(chan os.Signal, 1),
    verbose: true,
}

// Setup cleanup handler for a service
service.setupCleanupHandler("my-service")

// The cleanup will automatically trigger on Ctrl+C or SIGTERM
// Cleanup sequence:
// 1. Leave current intercept
// 2. Quit telepresence daemon  
// 3. Restore original namespace
// 4. Exit gracefully
```

The cleanup process uses a 30-second timeout context and provides verbose logging when enabled. It ensures the Telepresence session is properly terminated and the Kubernetes namespace is restored to its original state before exiting.
