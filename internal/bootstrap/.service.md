This service orchestrates the complete OpenFrame bootstrap process by combining cluster creation and chart installation into a single command execution flow.

## Key Components

**Service struct**: Main bootstrap service with no dependencies
- `NewService()` - Factory function for creating service instances
- `Execute()` - Main command handler that validates flags and coordinates bootstrap process
- `bootstrap()` - Core orchestration method that executes cluster creation followed by chart installation

**Helper Methods**:
- `createClusterSuppressed()` - Creates cluster with suppressed UI output
- `buildClusterConfig()` - Builds cluster configuration with sensible defaults
- `installChartWithMode()` - Installs charts with specified deployment mode

## Usage Example

```go
// Create and use the bootstrap service
service := NewService()

// Execute bootstrap with cobra command
err := service.Execute(cmd, []string{"my-cluster"})
if err != nil {
    log.Fatal(err)
}

// The service validates deployment modes and handles both interactive/non-interactive flows
```

The service supports three deployment modes (`oss-tenant`, `saas-tenant`, `saas-shared`) and requires deployment mode specification for non-interactive execution. It creates a default k3d cluster with 3 nodes when no cluster name is provided, then installs the OpenFrame charts from the default GitHub repository.
