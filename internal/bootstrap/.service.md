This service provides a streamlined bootstrap functionality that combines cluster creation and chart installation into a single command, supporting different deployment modes for the OpenFrame platform.

## Key Components

- **Service**: Main bootstrap service struct
- **NewService()**: Constructor for creating a new bootstrap service instance
- **Execute()**: Primary command handler that processes CLI flags and executes bootstrap workflow
- **bootstrap()**: Core method that orchestrates cluster creation followed by chart installation
- **createClusterSuppressed()**: Creates a k3d cluster with minimal UI output
- **buildClusterConfig()**: Constructs cluster configuration with sensible defaults
- **installChartWithMode()**: Installs OpenFrame charts with specified deployment mode

## Usage Example

```go
// Create and use the bootstrap service
service := NewService()

// Execute with cobra command (typically called by CLI)
err := service.Execute(cmd, []string{"my-cluster"})
if err != nil {
    log.Fatal(err)
}

// The service will:
// 1. Create a k3d cluster named "my-cluster" (or "openframe-dev" if not specified)
// 2. Install OpenFrame charts with the specified deployment mode
// 3. Support three deployment modes: "oss-tenant", "saas-tenant", "saas-shared"
// 4. Handle both interactive and non-interactive execution
```

The service validates deployment modes, manages verbose logging, and provides error handling consistent with other CLI commands. It serves as a convenience wrapper for users who want to quickly set up a complete OpenFrame development environment.
