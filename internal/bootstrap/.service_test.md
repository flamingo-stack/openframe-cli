This file contains unit tests for the bootstrap service, focusing on service structure validation and method availability without performing full integration testing.

## Key Components

- **TestNewService**: Validates the `NewService()` constructor returns a non-nil Service instance
- **TestServiceStructure**: Verifies the service can access required cluster and chart commands with their expected subcommands
- **TestServiceExecuteMethodExists**: Confirms the service has an Execute method without actually calling it
- **TestServiceArgumentHandling**: Tests service instantiation with various argument patterns
- **TestServiceVerboseFlagHandling**: Validates service behavior with different verbose flag states

## Usage Example

```go
// Run the complete test suite
go test ./bootstrap

// Run specific test
go test ./bootstrap -run TestNewService

// Run with verbose output
go test ./bootstrap -v

// Test service structure validation
service := NewService()
assert.NotNil(t, service)
assert.IsType(t, &Service{}, service)
```

The tests deliberately avoid integration testing by focusing on structural validation rather than end-to-end command execution, preventing the need for complex mocking while ensuring the service components are properly wired together.
