A platform-specific file that provides a no-op implementation of path expansion for non-Windows operating systems, ensuring cross-platform compatibility for the k3d package.

## Key Components

- **expandShortPath()** - A no-op function that returns the input path unchanged on non-Windows platforms

## Usage Example

```go
// On non-Windows platforms, this function simply returns the path as-is
expandedPath, err := expandShortPath("/home/user/project")
if err != nil {
    return err
}
// expandedPath will be "/home/user/project" (unchanged)
```

This file uses Go's build constraint `//go:build !windows` to ensure it's only compiled on non-Windows systems. On these platforms, Windows-specific 8.3 filename expansion is unnecessary, so the function acts as a pass-through. The corresponding Windows implementation would handle actual short path expansion using Windows APIs.
