This file implements a cross-platform installer for k3d, a tool for running Kubernetes clusters in Docker containers. It provides detection, installation help, and automated installation capabilities across macOS, Linux, and Windows platforms.

## Key Components

- **K3dInstaller**: Main struct that implements installation logic for k3d
- **commandExists()**: Helper function to check if a command is available in PATH
- **isK3dInstalled()**: Verifies if k3d is properly installed and functional
- **k3dInstallHelp()**: Provides platform-specific installation instructions
- **Install()**: Orchestrates platform-specific installation methods
- **Platform-specific installers**: Separate methods for macOS (Homebrew), Linux distributions, and script-based installation

## Usage Example

```go
// Create a new k3d installer instance
installer := NewK3dInstaller()

// Check if k3d is already installed
if !installer.IsInstalled() {
    fmt.Println("k3d not found")
    
    // Get installation help for current platform
    fmt.Println(installer.GetInstallHelp())
    
    // Attempt automatic installation
    if err := installer.Install(); err != nil {
        fmt.Printf("Installation failed: %v\n", err)
        return
    }
    
    fmt.Println("k3d installed successfully")
} else {
    fmt.Println("k3d is already installed")
}
```

The installer supports multiple installation methods including Homebrew on macOS, AUR packages on Arch Linux, and falls back to the official installation script when package managers aren't available. Windows requires manual installation due to platform limitations.
