This file provides cross-platform k3d installation and detection functionality for Kubernetes cluster management. It implements an installer that detects the operating system and uses the appropriate installation method for each platform.

## Key Components

- **K3dInstaller**: Main struct that handles k3d installation across different platforms
- **commandExists()**: Utility function to check if a command is available in PATH
- **isK3dInstalled()**: Verifies k3d installation by running version command
- **k3dInstallHelp()**: Provides platform-specific installation instructions
- **Install()**: Orchestrates automatic installation based on the operating system
- **Platform-specific installers**: Separate methods for macOS, Linux distributions, and binary installation

## Usage Example

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "log"
)

func main() {
    installer := k3d.NewK3dInstaller()
    
    // Check if k3d is already installed
    if installer.IsInstalled() {
        fmt.Println("k3d is already installed")
        return
    }
    
    // Show installation help
    fmt.Println(installer.GetInstallHelp())
    
    // Attempt automatic installation
    if err := installer.Install(); err != nil {
        log.Printf("Failed to install k3d: %v", err)
        fmt.Println("Please install manually:", installer.GetInstallHelp())
    } else {
        fmt.Println("k3d installed successfully")
    }
}
```

The installer supports various package managers including Homebrew (macOS), APT, YUM, DNF, Pacman, and AUR helpers, with fallback to the official k3d installation script for unsupported systems.
