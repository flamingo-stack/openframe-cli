This file contains unit tests for the prerequisites installer functionality, testing the creation of installer instances and tool installation methods.

## Key Components

- **TestNewInstaller()** - Tests proper initialization of the installer with its checker component
- **TestInstallTool()** - Validates tool installation logic for supported tools (docker, kubectl, k3d) and error handling for unknown tools
- **TestRunCommand()** - Verifies command execution functionality using a basic echo command
- **containsSubstring()** - Helper function for string matching in error validation

## Usage Example

Run the tests using Go's testing framework:

```go
// Run all tests in the package
go test

// Run specific test
go test -run TestNewInstaller

// Run with verbose output
go test -v
```

The tests validate that:
- The installer initializes correctly with all required components
- Known tools (docker, kubectl, k3d) are handled appropriately 
- Unknown tools return proper error messages
- Basic command execution works as expected

These tests ensure the installer's core functionality works reliably across different environments while providing meaningful error messages for debugging.
