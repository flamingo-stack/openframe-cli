A centralized prerequisite verification system that checks for required tools (Docker, kubectl, k3d) before cluster operations and provides installation guidance when dependencies are missing.

## Key Components

- **PrerequisiteChecker**: Main struct that manages a collection of tool requirements and their validation logic
- **Requirement**: Defines individual tool requirements with name, command, installation check, and help functions
- **NewPrerequisiteChecker()**: Factory function that initializes the checker with predefined requirements for Docker, kubectl, and k3d
- **CheckAll()**: Validates all requirements and returns success status plus list of missing tools
- **GetInstallInstructions()**: Generates installation help text for specific missing tools
- **CheckPrerequisites()**: Convenience function that performs complete check and install workflow

## Usage Example

```go
// Check all prerequisites
checker := NewPrerequisiteChecker()
allPresent, missing := checker.CheckAll()

if !allPresent {
    fmt.Printf("Missing tools: %v\n", missing)
    
    // Get installation instructions
    instructions := checker.GetInstallInstructions(missing)
    for _, instruction := range instructions {
        fmt.Println(instruction)
    }
}

// Or use the convenience function
if err := CheckPrerequisites(); err != nil {
    log.Fatal("Prerequisites check failed:", err)
}
```

The checker validates that Docker is running (not just installed), kubectl is available, and k3d is installed. Each requirement provides specific installation guidance through dedicated installer modules, making it easy to guide users through the setup process.
