This file contains unit tests for the installer functionality that handles automatic installation of required tools and dependencies.

## Key Components

- **TestNewInstaller**: Tests the creation of a new installer instance and validates it has proper initialization
- **TestInstallTool**: Tests tool installation behavior for various scenarios including memory constraints, unknown tools, and error handling
- **TestRunCommand**: Tests the command execution functionality with a simple echo command
- **containsSubstring**: Helper function for string matching in test assertions

## Usage Example

```go
// Run tests for the installer package
go test -v

// Test specific functions
go test -run TestNewInstaller
go test -run TestInstallTool

// Example of what the tests validate:
installer := NewInstaller()
// Tests verify installer is not nil and has proper checker

err := installer.installTool("memory")
// Tests expect this to fail with "memory cannot be automatically increased"

err = installer.runCommand("echo", "test")
// Tests expect this to succeed on all systems
```

The tests focus on error conditions and basic functionality while skipping actual installation of tools like git/helm/certificates to maintain test reliability and speed.
