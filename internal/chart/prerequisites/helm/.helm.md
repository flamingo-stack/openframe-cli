This file provides a cross-platform Helm installer that can detect, install, and provide installation guidance for the Helm Kubernetes package manager across different operating systems.

## Key Components

- **HelmInstaller struct**: Main installer type with methods for checking and installing Helm
- **commandExists()**: Utility function to check if a command is available in PATH
- **isHelmInstalled()**: Verifies if Helm is properly installed and functional
- **helmInstallHelp()**: Returns platform-specific installation instructions
- **Install()**: Orchestrates automatic installation based on the operating system
- **Platform-specific installers**: Separate methods for macOS, Linux distributions (Ubuntu, RHEL, Fedora, Arch), with fallback to official install script

## Usage Example

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "log"
)

func main() {
    installer := helm.NewHelmInstaller()
    
    // Check if Helm is installed
    if !installer.IsInstalled() {
        fmt.Println("Helm not found")
        fmt.Println(installer.GetInstallHelp())
        
        // Attempt automatic installation
        if err := installer.Install(); err != nil {
            log.Fatalf("Failed to install Helm: %v", err)
        }
        
        fmt.Println("Helm installed successfully")
    } else {
        fmt.Println("Helm is already installed")
    }
}
```

The installer handles platform detection automatically and uses the most appropriate installation method for each system, including package managers like brew, apt, dnf, pacman, or the official Helm installation script as a fallback.
