This service orchestrates the complete chart installation workflow for the OpenFrame CLI, managing configuration, cluster selection, and deployment processes with support for interactive, semi-interactive, and fully automated modes.

## Key Components

- **ChartService**: Main service that coordinates chart installation operations
- **InstallationWorkflow**: Orchestrates the multi-step installation process with context support
- **NewChartService()**: Factory function that initializes the service with dependencies
- **Install()/InstallWithContext()**: Entry points for chart installation with optional context cancellation
- **ExecuteWithContext()**: Core workflow execution with signal handling and cleanup

## Key Features

- **Multiple Operation Modes**: Supports fully interactive, partially interactive (pre-selected deployment), and non-interactive (CI/CD) modes
- **Signal Handling**: Graceful cancellation on CTRL-C with proper cleanup
- **Context Support**: Cancellable operations with parent context propagation
- **File Management**: Automatic cleanup of temporary files based on installation outcome
- **Cluster Integration**: Cluster selection and validation before deployment
- **Certificate Management**: Automatic certificate regeneration when needed

## Usage Example

```go
// Create chart service with dry-run and verbose options
chartService := NewChartService(false, true)

// Create installation request
req := utilTypes.InstallationRequest{
    DeploymentMode:   "oss-tenant",
    NonInteractive:   true,
    DryRun:          false,
    Verbose:         true,
    Args:            []string{"my-cluster"},
}

// Execute installation with timeout context
ctx, cancel := context.WithTimeout(context.Background(), 30*time.Minute)
defer cancel()

if err := chartService.InstallWithContext(ctx, req); err != nil {
    log.Fatalf("Installation failed: %v", err)
}
```

The service integrates Helm management, Git operations, cluster services, and UI components to provide a comprehensive chart deployment solution with robust error handling and cleanup mechanisms.
