This service manages Helm chart installation workflows with support for interactive and non-interactive deployment modes. It orchestrates the complete installation process including configuration, cluster selection, and chart deployment with proper error handling and cleanup.

## Key Components

- **ChartService**: Main service handling high-level chart operations with dependencies for cluster management, UI operations, and Helm management
- **InstallationWorkflow**: Orchestrates the complete installation process with context cancellation and signal handling
- **NewChartService()**: Factory function creating a configured service instance with real or dry-run executors
- **Install/InstallWithContext()**: Entry points for chart installation with optional context cancellation
- **ExecuteWithContext()**: Main workflow execution supporting three modes:
  - Fully interactive (default)
  - Partially non-interactive (pre-selected deployment mode)
  - Fully non-interactive (CI/CD mode)

## Usage Example

```go
// Create service with dry-run and verbose options
chartService := NewChartService(false, true)

// Create installation request
req := utilTypes.InstallationRequest{
    DeploymentMode:   "oss-tenant",
    NonInteractive:   false,
    DryRun:          false,
    Args:            []string{"my-cluster"},
    Verbose:         true,
}

// Install with context for cancellation support
ctx, cancel := context.WithTimeout(context.Background(), 30*time.Minute)
defer cancel()

err := chartService.InstallWithContext(ctx, req)
if err != nil {
    log.Fatal(err)
}
```
