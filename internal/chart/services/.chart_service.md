This file provides a high-level service for managing Helm chart installations with support for interactive configuration, cluster selection, and graceful error handling.

## Key Components

**ChartService**: Main service struct that orchestrates chart operations with dependencies for execution, cluster management, configuration, UI operations, and Helm/Git providers.

**InstallationWorkflow**: Internal workflow orchestrator that handles the complete installation process including configuration, cluster selection, certificate management, and cleanup.

**Key Methods**:
- `NewChartService()` - Creates a new service instance with dry-run and verbose options
- `Install()` / `InstallWithContext()` - Entry points for chart installation
- `selectCluster()` - Handles cluster selection logic
- `runConfigurationWizard()` - Interactive configuration setup
- `loadExistingConfiguration()` - Non-interactive configuration loading

## Usage Example

```go
// Create service with options
chartService := NewChartService(false, true) // dryRun=false, verbose=true

// Install chart interactively
req := utilTypes.InstallationRequest{
    Args:          []string{"my-cluster"},
    DryRun:        false,
    Verbose:       true,
    NonInteractive: false,
}

err := chartService.Install(req)
if err != nil {
    log.Fatalf("Installation failed: %v", err)
}

// Install in non-interactive mode (CI/CD)
req.NonInteractive = true
req.DeploymentMode = "oss-tenant"
err = chartService.InstallWithContext(ctx, req)
```

The service supports three modes: fully interactive, partially interactive (pre-selected deployment), and fully non-interactive for CI/CD environments.
