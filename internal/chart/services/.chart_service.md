<!-- source-hash: 3c01e63f10cffc26d1a8a7b8e73e3eed -->
A service for orchestrating Helm chart installations with support for interactive configuration, cluster selection, and deployment workflows. It provides both interactive and non-interactive modes for CI/CD environments.

## Key Components

- **ChartService** - Main service handling chart operations with dependency injection
- **InstallationWorkflow** - Orchestrates the complete installation process with context cancellation
- **NewChartService()** - Constructor accepting dry-run and verbose flags
- **Install()/InstallWithContext()** - Entry points for chart installation
- **ExecuteWithContext()** - Core workflow execution with signal handling and cleanup

## Usage Example

```go
// Create a chart service for interactive installation
chartService := NewChartService(false, true) // dryRun=false, verbose=true

// Install with basic request
req := utilTypes.InstallationRequest{
    Args:           []string{"my-cluster"},
    DryRun:        false,
    NonInteractive: false,
    Verbose:       true,
}

err := chartService.Install(req)
if err != nil {
    log.Fatal(err)
}

// Non-interactive installation for CI/CD
req = utilTypes.InstallationRequest{
    DeploymentMode:  "oss-tenant",
    NonInteractive: true,
    Verbose:       false,
}

ctx, cancel := context.WithTimeout(context.Background(), 30*time.Minute)
defer cancel()

err = chartService.InstallWithContext(ctx, req)
```

The service handles three operational modes: fully interactive (with configuration wizard), partially non-interactive (pre-selected deployment mode), and fully non-interactive (CI/CD with existing configuration). It includes graceful cancellation, file cleanup, and comprehensive error handling.
