Chart service provides high-level orchestration for OpenFrame chart installation operations, handling the complete workflow from configuration to deployment. It manages dependencies between UI components, cluster services, Helm operations, and Git repositories while supporting interactive, partial, and fully non-interactive installation modes.

## Key Components

- **ChartService**: Main service coordinating chart operations with configurable dry-run and verbose modes
- **InstallationWorkflow**: Orchestrates the multi-step installation process with context cancellation support
- **Install/InstallWithContext**: Entry points for chart installation with optional context cancellation
- **NewChartService**: Factory function creating service with all required dependencies

## Configuration Modes

The service supports three distinct installation modes:

1. **Fully Interactive**: Complete configuration wizard with user prompts
2. **Partial Non-Interactive**: Pre-selected deployment mode with remaining interactive steps  
3. **Fully Non-Interactive**: Complete automation using existing configuration files

## Usage Example

```go
// Create chart service with dry-run and verbose options
chartService := NewChartService(false, true)

// Install with basic request
req := utilTypes.InstallationRequest{
    Args:           []string{"cluster-name"},
    DryRun:         false,
    NonInteractive: false,
    DeploymentMode: "oss-tenant",
    Verbose:        true,
}

// Install with context for cancellation support
ctx, cancel := context.WithTimeout(context.Background(), 30*time.Minute)
defer cancel()

err := chartService.InstallWithContext(ctx, req)
if err != nil {
    log.Fatal(err)
}
```

The service handles signal interruption (CTRL-C), file cleanup, certificate regeneration, cluster selection, and ArgoCD synchronization as part of the complete installation workflow.
