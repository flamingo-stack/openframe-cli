This service orchestrates Helm chart installations for the OpenFrame CLI, providing both interactive and non-interactive workflows with support for different deployment modes (OSS, SaaS tenant, SaaS shared).

## Key Components

- **ChartService**: Main service that handles chart operations with dependencies for execution, cluster management, configuration, UI, Helm, and Git
- **InstallationWorkflow**: Orchestrates the complete installation process including configuration, cluster selection, and deployment
- **Install/InstallWithContext**: Primary methods to perform chart installations with cancellation support
- **NewChartService**: Factory function that initializes the service with real or dry-run command executors

## Usage Example

```go
// Create a new chart service
chartService := NewChartService(false, true) // dryRun=false, verbose=true

// Prepare installation request
req := utilTypes.InstallationRequest{
    DeploymentMode:   "oss-tenant",
    NonInteractive:   true,
    DryRun:          false,
    Args:            []string{"my-cluster"},
    Verbose:         true,
}

// Install with context for cancellation support
ctx, cancel := context.WithTimeout(context.Background(), 30*time.Minute)
defer cancel()

err := chartService.InstallWithContext(ctx, req)
if err != nil {
    log.Fatalf("Installation failed: %v", err)
}
```

The service supports three modes: fully interactive (default), partially interactive (pre-selected deployment mode), and fully non-interactive (CI/CD), with automatic cleanup of temporary files and graceful signal handling.
