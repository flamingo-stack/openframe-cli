This Go file implements a service for managing Helm chart installations with support for interactive configuration, cluster selection, and deployment workflows.

## Key Components

- **ChartService**: Main service struct that orchestrates chart operations with dependencies for execution, cluster management, configuration, UI operations, and Helm/Git providers
- **InstallationWorkflow**: Handles the complete installation process including configuration, cluster selection, certificate management, and cleanup
- **NewChartService()**: Factory function that creates a configured ChartService with real command executors and initialized dependencies
- **Install/InstallWithContext()**: Main entry points for chart installation with context support for cancellation
- **ExecuteWithContext()**: Core workflow execution with signal handling, configuration modes, and step-by-step installation process

## Usage Example

```go
// Create a new chart service
chartService := NewChartService(false, true) // dryRun=false, verbose=true

// Prepare installation request
req := types.InstallationRequest{
    DeploymentMode:    "oss-tenant",
    NonInteractive:   false,
    DryRun:           false,
    Verbose:          true,
    Args:             []string{"my-cluster"},
}

// Install charts with context
ctx := context.Background()
if err := chartService.InstallWithContext(ctx, req); err != nil {
    log.Fatalf("Installation failed: %v", err)
}
```

The service supports three configuration modes: fully interactive (default), partial non-interactive (pre-selected deployment mode), and fully non-interactive (CI/CD mode). It includes comprehensive error handling, signal management for graceful interruption, and automatic cleanup of temporary files.
