Orchestrates the complete chart installation process by coordinating ArgoCD and app-of-apps installations with proper error handling and context support.

## Key Components

- **Installer** - Main service that orchestrates chart installations
- **InstallCharts()** - Simplified installation method using background context
- **InstallChartsWithContext()** - Full installation method with context support for cancellation/timeouts
- **argoCDService** - Handles ArgoCD installation and application management
- **appOfAppsService** - Manages app-of-apps pattern installations from GitHub repositories

## Usage Example

```go
// Create installer with required services
installer := &Installer{
    argoCDService:    argoCDSvc,
    appOfAppsService: appOfAppsSvc,
}

// Basic installation
config := config.ChartInstallConfig{
    ClusterName: "production",
    // ... other config fields
}

if err := installer.InstallCharts(config); err != nil {
    log.Fatal("Installation failed:", err)
}

// Installation with context and timeout
ctx, cancel := context.WithTimeout(context.Background(), 10*time.Minute)
defer cancel()

if err := installer.InstallChartsWithContext(ctx, config); err != nil {
    log.Fatal("Installation failed:", err)
}
```

The installation process follows a specific sequence: ArgoCD is installed first, then if app-of-apps is configured, it's installed and the system waits for all ArgoCD applications to become ready. Special handling is provided for branch not found errors during app-of-apps installation.
