Provides interactive configuration for GitHub Container Registry (GHCR) credentials within the OpenFrame CLI chart configuration wizard. Handles both new credential setup and updates to existing credentials stored in chart configurations.

## Key Components

- **configureGHCRCredentials()**: Main method that manages GHCR credential collection through an interactive UI, with support for preserving existing credentials or updating them based on user choice.

## Usage Example

```go
wizard := &ConfigurationWizard{}
config := &types.ChartConfiguration{
    ExistingValues: map[string]interface{}{
        "registry": map[string]interface{}{
            "ghcr": map[string]interface{}{
                "username": "existing-user",
                "email": "user@example.com",
            },
        },
    },
}

username, password, email, err := wizard.configureGHCRCredentials(config)
if err != nil {
    log.Fatal(err)
}

fmt.Printf("Configured GHCR credentials for %s\n", username)
```

The method automatically detects existing credentials and offers options to keep or update them. Passwords are always prompted (not stored in plain text) and input is masked for security. All credential inputs are trimmed of whitespace before being returned.
