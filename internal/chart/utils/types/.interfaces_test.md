Test suite for validating workflow execution and installation request data structures. Tests the `WorkflowResult`, `StepResult`, and `InstallationRequest` types to ensure proper initialization, field assignment, and behavior across various scenarios.

## Key Components

- **WorkflowResult Tests**: Validates overall workflow execution results including success status, error handling, step tracking, execution time, and cluster identification
- **StepResult Tests**: Tests individual workflow step results with timing, success/failure states, and error propagation
- **InstallationRequest Tests**: Verifies installation configuration including command arguments, execution flags, repository settings, and certificate paths
- **Field Completeness Tests**: Ensures struct integrity by validating all expected fields are accessible

## Usage Example

```go
// Run all tests for the types package
go test ./types -v

// Run specific test functions
go test -run TestWorkflowResult_DefaultValues ./types
go test -run TestInstallationRequest_WithValues ./types

// Test with coverage
go test -cover ./types

// Example of how the tested structures are used
result := &WorkflowResult{
    Success:     true,
    Steps:       []StepResult{{StepName: "install", Success: true}},
    TotalTime:   30 * time.Second,
    ClusterName: "production",
}

request := &InstallationRequest{
    Args:         []string{"my-cluster"},
    Force:        true,
    GitHubRepo:   "https://github.com/user/repo",
    GitHubBranch: "main",
}
```
