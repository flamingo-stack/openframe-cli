Manages waiting for ArgoCD applications to reach healthy and synced status, with comprehensive monitoring, timeout handling, and graceful cancellation support.

## Key Components

- **WaitForApplications()** - Main method that waits for all ArgoCD applications to become healthy and synced
- **Context Management** - Handles cancellation from parent context and direct interrupt signals
- **Progress Monitoring** - Provides spinner UI and verbose logging for application status
- **Timeout Handling** - Implements 60-minute timeout with early exit conditions
- **Application Tracking** - Monitors applications that have achieved ready state during the session

## Usage Example

```go
manager := &argocd.Manager{
    executor: myExecutor,
}

config := config.ChartInstallConfig{
    Verbose: true,
    Silent:  false,
    DryRun:  false,
}

ctx, cancel := context.WithTimeout(context.Background(), 60*time.Minute)
defer cancel()

// Wait for all ArgoCD applications to be ready
err := manager.WaitForApplications(ctx, config)
if err != nil {
    log.Fatalf("Failed to wait for applications: %v", err)
}
```

The method includes sophisticated handling for:
- **Bootstrap Phase**: 30-second initial wait for applications to be created
- **Signal Handling**: Immediate response to Ctrl+C interrupts
- **Progress Tracking**: Visual feedback via spinner and detailed verbose logging
- **Smart Timeouts**: Early exit when context deadlines are too short
- **Application Debugging**: Detailed pod status information for stuck applications after 7 minutes
