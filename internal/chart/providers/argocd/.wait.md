This file provides functionality to wait for ArgoCD applications to reach a healthy and synced state during deployment. It includes comprehensive monitoring, progress tracking, and graceful cancellation handling.

## Key Components

**Main Function:**
- `WaitForApplications()` - Waits for all ArgoCD applications to be Healthy and Synced

**Features:**
- Context cancellation and signal handling (Ctrl+C)
- Progress tracking with spinner UI
- Bootstrap phase (30 seconds) + main monitoring (60 minutes timeout)
- Verbose logging with detailed application status
- Debug mode for stuck applications after 7 minutes

## Usage Example

```go
package main

import (
    "context"
    "time"
    
    "github.com/flamingo-stack/openframe-cli/internal/chart/utils/config"
)

func main() {
    ctx, cancel := context.WithTimeout(context.Background(), 70*time.Minute)
    defer cancel()
    
    manager := &Manager{
        executor: executor,
    }
    
    config := config.ChartInstallConfig{
        DryRun:  false,
        Verbose: true,
        Silent:  false,
    }
    
    // Wait for all ArgoCD applications to be ready
    err := manager.WaitForApplications(ctx, config)
    if err != nil {
        log.Fatalf("Failed to wait for applications: %v", err)
    }
    
    fmt.Println("All ArgoCD applications are healthy and synced!")
}
```

The function automatically skips waiting in dry-run mode and provides real-time progress updates with application status tracking. It handles both graceful cancellation and timeout scenarios, making it suitable for CI/CD pipelines and interactive deployments.
