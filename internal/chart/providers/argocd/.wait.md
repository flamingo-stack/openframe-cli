This file provides functionality to wait for ArgoCD applications to reach a healthy and synced state during chart installations. It handles graceful cancellation, progress monitoring, and detailed verbose logging throughout the synchronization process.

## Key Components

- **`WaitForApplications(ctx, config)`** - Main function that waits for all ArgoCD applications to become healthy and synced
- **Context management** - Handles cancellation signals and timeouts gracefully
- **Progress monitoring** - Shows spinner with real-time progress updates
- **Verbose logging** - Provides detailed status information and debugging output
- **Bootstrap phase** - Initial 30-second wait period for applications to be created
- **Timeout handling** - 60-minute maximum wait time with early exit conditions

## Usage Example

```go
manager := &Manager{
    executor: commandExecutor,
}

ctx, cancel := context.WithTimeout(context.Background(), 70*time.Minute)
defer cancel()

config := config.ChartInstallConfig{
    Verbose: true,
    Silent:  false,
    DryRun:  false,
}

err := manager.WaitForApplications(ctx, config)
if err != nil {
    log.Fatalf("Failed to wait for applications: %v", err)
}
```

The function automatically skips execution in dry-run mode and provides immediate response to cancellation signals. It tracks application states and shows progress through either a spinner (interactive) or simple log messages (silent mode).
