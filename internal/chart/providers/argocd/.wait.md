This file implements ArgoCD application monitoring functionality that waits for applications to reach a healthy and synchronized state during deployment.

## Key Components

- **WaitForApplications()** - Main function that monitors ArgoCD applications until they reach "Healthy" and "Synced" status
- **Context management** - Handles cancellation via parent context and direct interrupt signals (Ctrl+C)
- **Progress tracking** - Uses pterm spinner with real-time progress updates and verbose logging
- **Bootstrap phase** - Initial 30-second wait period for applications to be created
- **Timeout handling** - 60-minute maximum wait time with early exit conditions
- **Application state tracking** - Monitors which applications have ever been ready during the session

## Usage Example

```go
manager := &Manager{
    executor: someExecutor,
}

config := config.ChartInstallConfig{
    DryRun:  false,
    Verbose: true,
    Silent:  false,
}

ctx := context.Background()
err := manager.WaitForApplications(ctx, config)
if err != nil {
    log.Fatalf("Failed to wait for applications: %v", err)
}
```

The function provides comprehensive monitoring with graceful cancellation, detailed progress reporting, and debugging information for stuck applications. It skips execution in dry-run mode and handles various timeout scenarios intelligently.
