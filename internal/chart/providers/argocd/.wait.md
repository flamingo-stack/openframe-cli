Provides wait functionality for ArgoCD applications to reach healthy and synced status, with comprehensive error handling, cluster health monitoring, and recovery mechanisms for Windows/WSL environments.

## Key Components

- **WaitForApplications**: Main function that waits for ArgoCD applications to become healthy and synced
- **Bootstrap phase**: 30-second initial wait with cluster health checks every 5 seconds
- **Main monitoring loop**: Continuous monitoring with 2-second application checks and periodic cluster health validation
- **Signal handling**: Graceful cancellation support for Ctrl+C interrupts
- **Recovery mechanisms**: WSL recovery for Windows environments and repo-server restart capabilities
- **Progress tracking**: Spinner-based UI with verbose logging options

## Usage Example

```go
package main

import (
    "context"
    "time"
    
    "github.com/flamingo-stack/openframe-cli/internal/chart/utils/config"
    "github.com/flamingo-stack/openframe-cli/internal/argocd"
)

func main() {
    manager := &argocd.Manager{}
    
    config := config.ChartInstallConfig{
        Verbose:     true,
        Silent:      false,
        DryRun:      false,
        ClusterName: "my-cluster",
        SkipCRDs:    false,
    }
    
    ctx, cancel := context.WithTimeout(context.Background(), 60*time.Minute)
    defer cancel()
    
    err := manager.WaitForApplications(ctx, config)
    if err != nil {
        log.Fatalf("Failed to wait for applications: %v", err)
    }
    
    log.Println("All ArgoCD applications are healthy and synced")
}
```

The function includes sophisticated timeout handling (60-minute default), exponential backoff for failed connectivity checks, and special handling for Windows/WSL environments where connectivity issues are more common. It tracks application readiness state and provides detailed progress reporting through configurable spinner UI and verbose logging modes.
