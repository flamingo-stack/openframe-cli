This file defines data structures for git operations, specifically for handling the results of git clone operations in a Helm chart context.

## Key Components

- **CloneResult**: A struct that encapsulates the outcome of a git clone operation, containing the temporary directory path and the specific chart path within the cloned repository.

## Usage Example

```go
package main

import "your-module/git"

func main() {
    // Create a CloneResult after a successful git clone
    result := git.CloneResult{
        TempDir:   "/tmp/helm-clone-12345",
        ChartPath: "/tmp/helm-clone-12345/charts/my-app",
    }
    
    // Use the result to access cloned chart
    fmt.Printf("Chart located at: %s\n", result.ChartPath)
    
    // Clean up temporary directory when done
    defer os.RemoveAll(result.TempDir)
}
```

The `CloneResult` struct is typically returned by git clone functions to provide both the temporary directory location (for cleanup purposes) and the specific path to the Helm chart within the cloned repository.
