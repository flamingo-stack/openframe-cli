A simple data structure that encapsulates the results of a Git clone operation, providing paths to both the temporary directory and the chart location.

## Key Components

- **CloneResult**: A struct containing two string fields that hold filesystem paths returned from Git clone operations

## Usage Example

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "your-project/git"
)

func main() {
    // Typically returned from a git clone function
    result := git.CloneResult{
        TempDir:   "/tmp/helm-chart-12345",
        ChartPath: "/tmp/helm-chart-12345/charts/myapp",
    }
    
    fmt.Printf("Repository cloned to: %s\n", result.TempDir)
    fmt.Printf("Chart found at: %s\n", result.ChartPath)
    
    // Use the paths for further processing
    // defer cleanup of result.TempDir
}
```

The `TempDir` field typically points to the root of the cloned repository, while `ChartPath` points to the specific chart directory within that repository. This structure is commonly used in Helm chart processing workflows where repositories need to be temporarily cloned to access chart definitions.
