This file defines the core data structures for git operations within the application, specifically for handling git clone results.

## Key Components

- **CloneResult**: A struct that encapsulates the outcome of a git clone operation, containing both the temporary directory location and the path to the chart within that directory.

## Usage Example

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "your-app/git"
)

func handleCloneOperation() {
    // Example of using CloneResult after a git clone operation
    result := git.CloneResult{
        TempDir:   "/tmp/clone-12345",
        ChartPath: "/tmp/clone-12345/charts/my-chart",
    }
    
    fmt.Printf("Repository cloned to: %s\n", result.TempDir)
    fmt.Printf("Chart located at: %s\n", result.ChartPath)
    
    // Use the paths for further processing
    processChart(result.ChartPath)
    
    // Clean up temporary directory when done
    defer cleanupTempDir(result.TempDir)
}
```

The `CloneResult` struct provides a clean interface for passing around the results of git clone operations, ensuring that both the temporary directory location and the specific chart path are available for subsequent processing steps.
