Defines types for git operations, specifically for handling the results of git clone operations in the context of Helm chart management.

## Key Components

- **`CloneResult`** - Struct that encapsulates the outcome of a git clone operation, containing paths to the temporary directory and chart location

## Usage Example

```go
package main

import "your-project/git"

func handleCloneOperation() {
    result := git.CloneResult{
        TempDir:   "/tmp/helm-clone-abc123",
        ChartPath: "/tmp/helm-clone-abc123/charts/my-app",
    }
    
    // Use the temporary directory for chart operations
    defer os.RemoveAll(result.TempDir)
    
    // Process the chart at the specified path
    processChart(result.ChartPath)
}
```

This type is typically used as a return value from git clone functions to provide callers with both the temporary directory location (for cleanup purposes) and the specific path to the cloned Helm chart within that directory.
