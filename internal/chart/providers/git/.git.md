This file defines the data structures used to represent the results of Git operations, specifically for cloning repositories containing Helm charts.

## Key Components

**CloneResult struct**
- `TempDir` (string) - Path to the temporary directory where the repository was cloned
- `ChartPath` (string) - Path to the specific Helm chart directory within the cloned repository

## Usage Example

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "github.com/your-org/your-project/git"
)

func handleCloneOperation() {
    // Typically returned from a clone function
    result := git.CloneResult{
        TempDir:   "/tmp/repo-12345",
        ChartPath: "/tmp/repo-12345/charts/my-chart",
    }
    
    fmt.Printf("Repository cloned to: %s\n", result.TempDir)
    fmt.Printf("Chart located at: %s\n", result.ChartPath)
    
    // Use the paths for further operations
    // Remember to clean up TempDir when done
}
```

This structure provides a clean way to pass both the temporary directory location and the specific chart path back to callers after a successful Git clone operation, enabling proper cleanup and chart processing workflows.
