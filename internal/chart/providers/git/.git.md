Simple data structure defining the result of a git clone operation, containing the temporary directory path and chart path for cloned repositories.

## Key Components

- **CloneResult**: Struct that encapsulates the output of git clone operations with two string fields for directory paths

## Usage Example

```go
package main

import "your-module/git"

func handleCloneOperation() {
    result := git.CloneResult{
        TempDir:   "/tmp/clone-12345",
        ChartPath: "/tmp/clone-12345/charts/my-chart",
    }
    
    // Access the temporary directory where repo was cloned
    fmt.Printf("Repository cloned to: %s\n", result.TempDir)
    
    // Access the specific chart path within the cloned repo
    fmt.Printf("Chart located at: %s\n", result.ChartPath)
}
```

This type is typically returned by git cloning functions to provide both the base temporary directory and the specific path to chart files within the cloned repository.
