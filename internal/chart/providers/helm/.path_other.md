A platform-specific implementation for non-Windows systems that provides a no-operation path expansion function, ensuring cross-platform compatibility for Helm path handling.

## Key Components

- **expandShortPath()** - No-operation function that returns the input path unchanged on non-Windows platforms

## Usage Example

```go
// On non-Windows platforms (Linux, macOS, etc.)
originalPath := "/usr/local/bin/helm"
expandedPath, err := expandShortPath(originalPath)
// expandedPath will be "/usr/local/bin/helm" (unchanged)
// err will be nil
```

This file uses Go's build constraints (`//go:build !windows`) to ensure it's only compiled on non-Windows platforms. On these systems, Windows-specific short filename expansion (8.3 format) is not needed, so the function simply returns the original path without modification. This provides a consistent API across all platforms while avoiding unnecessary processing on systems that don't support Windows short filenames.
