Test suite for the `ui` package's utility functions, specifically validating the `FormatAge` function's time formatting behavior.

## Key Components

- **TestFormatAge**: Main test function that validates age formatting across different time units (seconds, minutes, hours, days) and handles the zero time edge case
- **TestFormatAgeEdgeCases**: Additional tests for boundary conditions including very recent times and future timestamps

## Usage Example

```go
// Run the tests
go test ./ui -v

// Run specific test cases
go test ./ui -run TestFormatAge
go test ./ui -run TestFormatAgeEdgeCases

// The tests validate FormatAge function behavior:
// - Zero time returns "unknown"
// - Recent times return format like "30s", "5m", "2h", "3d"
// - Edge cases handle very recent and future times gracefully
```

The test suite uses table-driven testing for the main scenarios and includes tolerance for time-sensitive operations. It verifies both exact matches for the zero time case and unit suffixes for time-based calculations to account for test execution timing variations.
