This file provides system-level configuration and initialization services, primarily focused on managing logging directories and system-wide settings for the application.

## Key Components

- **SystemService**: Main struct that handles system-level operations including log directory management
- **NewSystemService()**: Creates a system service with default log directory in temp folder
- **NewSystemServiceWithOptions(logDir string)**: Creates a system service with custom log directory
- **Initialize()**: Performs system initialization including log directory setup
- **GetLogDirectory()**: Returns the configured log directory path

## Usage Example

```go
// Create system service with default settings
sysService := config.NewSystemService()

// Or create with custom log directory
sysService := config.NewSystemServiceWithOptions("/var/log/myapp")

// Initialize the system (creates log directories)
if err := sysService.Initialize(); err != nil {
    log.Fatalf("System initialization failed: %v", err)
}

// Get the log directory path for use elsewhere
logPath := sysService.GetLogDirectory()
fmt.Printf("Logs will be written to: %s\n", logPath)
```

The service ensures proper directory structure exists before the application starts logging operations.
