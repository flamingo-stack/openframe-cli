Provides system-level configuration and initialization services for the application, including logging directory setup and system-wide settings management.

## Key Components

- **SystemService** - Main service struct that manages system configuration with a configurable log directory
- **NewSystemService()** - Creates a system service with default log directory in system temp
- **NewSystemServiceWithOptions()** - Creates a system service with custom log directory path
- **Initialize()** - Performs system initialization including log directory creation
- **GetLogDirectory()** - Returns the configured log directory path

## Usage Example

```go
// Create system service with defaults
sysService := config.NewSystemService()

// Or with custom log directory
sysService := config.NewSystemServiceWithOptions("/var/log/myapp")

// Initialize the system
if err := sysService.Initialize(); err != nil {
    log.Fatal("System initialization failed:", err)
}

// Get log directory for use in other components
logDir := sysService.GetLogDirectory()
fmt.Printf("Logs will be written to: %s\n", logDir)
```

The service automatically creates the log directory with appropriate permissions (0755) during initialization, making it ready for logging components to use.
