This file contains unit tests for the `intercept` command functionality, which is part of a CLI tool that enables traffic interception between Kubernetes clusters and local development environments using Telepresence.

## Key Components

- **TestGetInterceptCmd**: Tests the command structure, properties, and flag definitions
- **TestInterceptCmd_FlagBinding**: Validates that command flags are properly bound to the InterceptFlags model
- **TestInterceptCmd_Examples**: Ensures usage examples are present in the command documentation
- **TestInterceptCmd_PreRunE**: Verifies the command's pre-execution hook configuration

The tests cover all intercept command flags including `port`, `namespace`, `mount`, `env-file`, `global`, `header`, `replace`, and `remote-port`, along with their default values and binding behavior.

## Usage Example

```go
// Run the intercept command tests
go test -v ./intercept_test.go

// The tests validate command structure like:
cmd := getInterceptCmd()
assert.Contains(t, cmd.Use, "intercept")
assert.Equal(t, "Intercept cluster traffic to local development environment", cmd.Short)

// And flag binding:
cmd.Flags().Set("port", "9090")
port, _ := cmd.Flags().GetInt("port")
assert.Equal(t, 9090, port)
```

The tests ensure the intercept command is properly configured with all necessary flags and maintains correct default values for reliable traffic interception workflows.
