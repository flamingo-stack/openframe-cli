This file provides the main command structure for development tools in the OpenFrame CLI, offering local Kubernetes workflows with Telepresence traffic interception and Skaffold deployment capabilities.

## Key Components

- **GetDevCmd()**: Creates and configures the root `dev` command with aliases and subcommands
- **PersistentPreRunE**: Handles logo display and prerequisite checks for subcommands
- **Subcommands**: Integrates `intercept` and `skaffold` commands for development workflows
- **Global Flags**: Applies shared configuration flags using the models package

## Usage Example

```go
// Get the dev command with all subcommands
devCmd := GetDevCmd()

// The command supports these workflows:
// openframe dev intercept my-service    - Intercept cluster traffic locally
// openframe dev skaffold my-service     - Deploy with live reloading
// openframe dev                         - Show help and available commands

// Add to root command
rootCmd.AddCommand(devCmd)
```

The command automatically validates prerequisites (Telepresence for intercept, Skaffold for deployment) and displays the OpenFrame logo when appropriate. It serves as the entry point for local development workflows that bridge local code with remote Kubernetes clusters.
