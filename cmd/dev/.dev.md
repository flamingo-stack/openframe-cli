A command factory that creates the main `dev` command for local Kubernetes development workflows, including traffic interception and live deployment capabilities.

## Key Components

**GetDevCmd()** - Returns a configured Cobra command with:
- Main `dev` command with aliases (`d`)
- Subcommands for `intercept` and `skaffold` operations
- Prerequisite checking for development tools
- Global flag support via models package

**Command Structure:**
- `intercept` - Traffic interception from cluster services to local development
- `skaffold` - Development service deployment with live reloading
- Uses Telepresence and Skaffold for development workflows

## Usage Example

```go
import (
    "github.com/flamingo-stack/openframe-cli/internal/dev"
    "github.com/spf13/cobra"
)

// Add dev command to root CLI
rootCmd := &cobra.Command{Use: "openframe"}
rootCmd.AddCommand(dev.GetDevCmd())

// Usage in CLI:
// openframe dev intercept my-service
// openframe dev skaffold my-service
// openframe d intercept my-service  // using alias
```

The command includes automatic prerequisite validation and displays the application logo when executed. It leverages the shared UI package for consistent branding and the models package for common flag management.
