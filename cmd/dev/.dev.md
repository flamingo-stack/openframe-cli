This file defines the main `dev` command for the OpenFrame CLI, providing development tools for local Kubernetes workflows including traffic interception and live reloading capabilities.

## Key Components

- **GetDevCmd()** - Returns the root `dev` command with subcommands for intercept and skaffold operations
- **PersistentPreRunE** - Validates prerequisites for intercept (Telepresence) and skaffold operations before execution
- **Subcommands** - Integrates `intercept` and `skaffold` subcommands for development workflows
- **Global flags** - Adds shared configuration flags using the models package

## Usage Example

```go
// Get the dev command with all subcommands
devCmd := GetDevCmd()

// The command supports these operations:
// openframe dev intercept my-service    - Intercept cluster traffic locally
// openframe dev skaffold my-service     - Deploy with live reloading
// openframe dev                         - Show help and logo

// Add to root CLI command
rootCmd.AddCommand(devCmd)
```

The command automatically checks prerequisites (Telepresence for intercept, Skaffold tools for skaffold) and displays the OpenFrame logo when appropriate. It serves as the entry point for local development workflows that integrate with Kubernetes clusters.
