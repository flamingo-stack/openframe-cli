Core command module for development tools in the OpenFrame CLI, providing local Kubernetes workflows through traffic interception and live development deployment.

## Key Components

- **`GetDevCmd()`** - Returns the main dev command with intercept and skaffold subcommands
- **Aliases** - Supports "d" as a shorthand for "dev"
- **Prerequisites checking** - Validates required tools before running subcommands
- **Subcommand structure** - Organizes intercept and skaffold functionality under dev namespace

## Usage Example

```go
// Get the dev command group
devCmd := GetDevCmd()

// Add to root command
rootCmd.AddCommand(devCmd)

// The command provides these workflows:
// openframe dev intercept my-service    - Intercept cluster traffic locally
// openframe dev skaffold my-service     - Deploy with live reloading
// openframe d intercept my-service      - Using alias
```

The command automatically shows the OpenFrame logo for subcommands and validates prerequisites like Telepresence (for intercept) and Skaffold tools before execution. When called without subcommands, it displays help information with available development workflows.
