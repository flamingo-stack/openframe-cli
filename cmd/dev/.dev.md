This file defines the main `dev` command for the OpenFrame CLI, providing development workflow tools for local Kubernetes development with traffic interception and live reloading capabilities.

## Key Components

- **GetDevCmd()** - Returns the root `dev` command with subcommands for `intercept` and `skaffold`
- **PersistentPreRunE** - Validates prerequisites for Telepresence and Skaffold based on subcommand
- **Subcommands** - Integrates `getInterceptCmd()` and `getScaffoldCmd()` functions
- **Global flags** - Adds shared configuration flags via `models.AddGlobalFlags()`

## Usage Example

```go
// Get the dev command and add it to your CLI
devCmd := GetDevCmd()
rootCmd.AddCommand(devCmd)

// The command supports these workflows:
// openframe dev intercept my-service    # Intercept cluster traffic locally  
// openframe dev skaffold my-service     # Deploy with live reloading
// openframe dev                         # Show help and logo
```

The command automatically validates that required tools (Telepresence for intercept, Skaffold for deployment) are installed before execution and displays the OpenFrame logo for better user experience.
