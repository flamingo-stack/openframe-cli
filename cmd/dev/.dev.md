Main entry point for development tools that provides a Cobra CLI command for local Kubernetes workflows with traffic interception and live reloading capabilities.

## Key Components

- **GetDevCmd()** - Returns the root `dev` command with subcommands for traffic interception and Skaffold deployment
- **PersistentPreRunE** - Validates prerequisites for intercept and Skaffold operations
- **Subcommands** - Integrates `intercept` and `skaffold` commands for development workflows

## Usage Example

This command structure enables development workflows through the CLI:

```go
// Getting the dev command with all subcommands
devCmd := GetDevCmd()

// The command supports these usage patterns:
// openframe dev intercept my-service
// openframe dev skaffold my-service
// openframe dev (shows help)

// Prerequisites are automatically checked:
// - Telepresence for intercept operations
// - Skaffold for deployment operations
```

The command provides a unified interface for local development against Kubernetes clusters, automatically validating tool dependencies and showing contextual help with the application logo.
