This file defines the main development command group for the OpenFrame CLI, providing local Kubernetes development workflows with traffic interception and live reloading capabilities.

## Key Components

- **GetDevCmd()** - Returns the root `dev` command with subcommands for local development workflows
- **PersistentPreRunE** - Validates prerequisites for Telepresence (intercept) and Skaffold operations
- **Subcommands** - Integrates `intercept` and `skaffold` commands for development workflows
- **Global Flags** - Applies shared flags using the models package pattern

## Usage Example

```go
// Get the dev command group
devCmd := dev.GetDevCmd()

// Add to root command
rootCmd.AddCommand(devCmd)

// Command supports these workflows:
// openframe dev intercept my-service    - Traffic interception
// openframe dev skaffold my-service     - Live reloading deployment
// openframe dev                         - Show help with logo
```

The command automatically checks prerequisites based on the subcommand being executed - Telepresence for intercept operations and Skaffold for development deployments. It displays the OpenFrame logo for subcommands and help output while providing a consistent development workflow interface.
