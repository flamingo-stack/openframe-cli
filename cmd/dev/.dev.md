Development command orchestrator for local Kubernetes workflows, providing traffic interception and live reloading capabilities through Telepresence and Skaffold integration.

## Key Components

- **GetDevCmd()** - Main command factory that creates the `dev` command with subcommands for local development workflows
- **PersistentPreRunE** - Prerequisite validation logic that checks requirements for intercept and skaffold operations
- **Subcommands** - Integrates `getInterceptCmd()` and `getScaffoldCmd()` for traffic routing and deployment workflows

## Usage Example

```go
// Get the complete dev command with all subcommands
devCmd := GetDevCmd()

// The command supports these workflows:
// openframe dev intercept my-service    // Route cluster traffic to local dev
// openframe dev skaffold my-service     // Deploy with live reloading
// openframe dev                         // Show help and available options

// Add to root command
rootCmd.AddCommand(devCmd)
```

The command automatically validates prerequisites like Telepresence installation for intercept operations and Skaffold availability for deployment workflows. It includes global flags through the models package and provides contextual help with logo display. The command follows the CLI pattern of showing help when no subcommand is specified, making it discoverable for developers setting up local Kubernetes development environments.
