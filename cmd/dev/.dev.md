A development command entry point that provides local Kubernetes workflow tools including traffic interception and live reloading capabilities through Telepresence and Skaffold integration.

## Key Components

- **GetDevCmd()** - Returns the main dev command with subcommands and aliases
- **PersistentPreRunE** - Validates prerequisites for intercept and skaffold operations
- **RunE** - Shows help when no subcommand is provided
- **Subcommands** - Includes intercept and skaffold workflow commands

## Usage Example

```go
// Get the dev command for CLI registration
devCmd := dev.GetDevCmd()

// The command supports these operations:
// openframe dev intercept my-service
// openframe dev skaffold my-service
// openframe dev --help

// Register with root command
rootCmd.AddCommand(devCmd)
```

The command automatically checks prerequisites before executing intercept or skaffold operations, displays the application logo for subcommands, and provides comprehensive help text with usage examples. It supports the alias "d" for shorter command invocation and includes global flags through the models package.
