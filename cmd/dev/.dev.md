Provides the main development command for the OpenFrame CLI, organizing development workflow tools under a single command group with intercept and skaffold subcommands.

## Key Components

- **GetDevCmd()** - Returns the root "dev" command with aliases and subcommands
- **PersistentPreRunE** - Validates prerequisites for intercept (Telepresence) and skaffold operations
- **Subcommands** - Adds intercept and skaffold commands via `getInterceptCmd()` and `getScaffoldCmd()`
- **Global flags** - Applies shared flags using `models.AddGlobalFlags()`

## Usage Example

```go
// Get the dev command with all subcommands
devCmd := GetDevCmd()

// The command supports these workflows:
// openframe dev intercept my-service    (traffic interception)
// openframe dev skaffold my-cluster     (live reloading deployments)
// openframe dev                         (shows help)

// Add to root command
rootCmd.AddCommand(devCmd)
```

The command automatically validates prerequisites before executing subcommands - checking for Telepresence installation for intercept operations and Skaffold for development deployments. When called without arguments, it displays the logo and help information.
