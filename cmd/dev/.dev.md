This file provides the main development command for the OpenFrame CLI, offering local Kubernetes development workflows with traffic interception and live reloading capabilities.

## Key Components

- **GetDevCmd()** - Returns the main `dev` command with subcommands for intercept and skaffold operations
- **PersistentPreRunE** - Validates prerequisites for intercept (Telepresence) and skaffold operations before execution
- **Subcommands** - Integrates intercept and skaffold commands for development workflows
- **Global flags** - Adds shared configuration flags following the cluster pattern

## Usage Example

```go
// Get the dev command with all subcommands
devCmd := GetDevCmd()

// The command supports these workflows:
// openframe dev intercept my-service    (traffic interception)
// openframe dev skaffold my-service     (live reloading deployment)

// Add to root command
rootCmd.AddCommand(devCmd)
```

The command automatically checks prerequisites based on the subcommand being used and displays the OpenFrame logo appropriately. It serves as the entry point for local development tools that integrate with Kubernetes clusters through Telepresence and Skaffold.
