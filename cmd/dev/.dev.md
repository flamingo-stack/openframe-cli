This file provides the main entry point for development-related CLI commands, creating a parent command that orchestrates local Kubernetes development workflows with Telepresence and Skaffold.

## Key Components

- **GetDevCmd()** - Returns the main dev command with subcommands for traffic interception and development deployment
- **PersistentPreRunE** - Handles UI display and prerequisite validation for subcommands
- **RunE** - Shows help when no subcommand is specified
- Subcommands: `intercept` and `skaffold` (from separate functions)
- Global flags integration via `models.AddGlobalFlags()`

## Usage Example

```go
// Get the dev command with all subcommands
devCmd := GetDevCmd()

// The command supports these usage patterns:
// openframe dev                    - shows help
// openframe dev intercept service  - intercepts traffic
// openframe dev skaffold cluster   - deploys with live reload

// Add to root command
rootCmd.AddCommand(devCmd)
```

The command includes built-in prerequisite checking for Telepresence (intercept) and Skaffold workflows, displays the application logo contextually, and provides both short alias (`d`) and comprehensive help documentation for development workflows.
