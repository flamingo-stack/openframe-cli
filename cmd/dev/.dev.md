Development command initialization and configuration for local Kubernetes workflows including traffic interception and live reloading capabilities.

## Key Components

- **GetDevCmd()** - Main function that creates and configures the `dev` command with subcommands for local development workflows
- **PersistentPreRunE** - Middleware that handles UI display and prerequisite validation for intercept and skaffold operations
- **Subcommands** - Integrates intercept and skaffold commands for development workflows
- **Global Flags** - Applies shared configuration flags across all dev subcommands

## Usage Example

```go
// Get the dev command for CLI registration
devCmd := dev.GetDevCmd()

// The command supports these workflows:
// openframe dev intercept my-service    # Traffic interception
// openframe dev skaffold my-cluster     # Live reloading deployment
// openframe dev                         # Show help and available commands

// Prerequisites are automatically checked:
// - Telepresence installation for intercept
// - Skaffold installation for skaffold workflows
```

The command acts as a parent for development tools, automatically validating prerequisites based on the selected subcommand and providing consistent UI experience with logo display and help functionality.
