Entry point for the dev command group that provides local Kubernetes development workflows including traffic interception and live service deployment.

## Key Components

- **GetDevCmd()** - Returns the main dev command with aliases, help text, and subcommand registration
- **PersistentPreRunE** - Handles logo display and prerequisite validation for intercept and skaffold operations
- **RunE** - Shows help when no subcommand is provided
- **Subcommand registration** - Adds intercept and skaffold commands with global flags

## Usage Example

```go
// Get the dev command with all subcommands
devCmd := GetDevCmd()

// The command supports aliases and provides comprehensive help
// CLI usage examples:
//   openframe dev                    # Shows help
//   openframe dev intercept my-svc   # Traffic interception
//   openframe d skaffold my-cluster  # Live deployment
```

The command performs prerequisite checks automatically based on the subcommand being executed and displays the OpenFrame logo appropriately. It integrates with the broader CLI structure through global flags and follows the established command patterns.
