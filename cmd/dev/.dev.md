Main entry point for the development command group that provides local Kubernetes development workflows with traffic interception and live reloading capabilities.

## Key Components

- **`GetDevCmd()`** - Returns the root `dev` command with subcommands and global configuration
- **Subcommands** - `intercept` and `skaffold` commands for development workflows
- **Prerequisites validation** - Automatic checking of required tools before command execution
- **Global flags** - Shared configuration options across all dev subcommands

## Usage Example

```go
// Get the dev command with all subcommands
devCmd := GetDevCmd()

// Add to root command
rootCmd.AddCommand(devCmd)

// The command supports these workflows:
// openframe dev intercept my-service    # Intercept traffic to local dev
// openframe dev skaffold my-service     # Deploy with live reloading
// openframe dev                         # Show help and available commands
```

The command automatically validates prerequisites (Telepresence for intercept, Skaffold for deployment) and displays the CLI logo for better user experience. All subcommands inherit global flags for consistent configuration across development workflows.
