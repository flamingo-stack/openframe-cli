This file provides the main development command interface for the Openframe CLI, offering local Kubernetes development workflows with Telepresence and Skaffold integration.

## Key Components

- **GetDevCmd()** - Returns the root `dev` command with subcommands for traffic interception and development deployment
- **PersistentPreRunE** - Handles prerequisite checking for intercept and skaffold operations
- **Subcommands** - Integrates intercept and skaffold commands via `getInterceptCmd()` and `getScaffoldCmd()`
- **Global flags** - Adds shared configuration flags through `models.AddGlobalFlags()`

## Usage Example

```go
// Get the dev command and add it to your CLI
devCmd := GetDevCmd()
rootCmd.AddCommand(devCmd)

// The command supports these workflows:
// openframe dev intercept my-service    // Traffic interception
// openframe dev skaffold my-cluster     // Development deployment
// openframe dev                         // Shows help and logo
```

The command automatically validates prerequisites (Telepresence for intercept, Skaffold tools for deployment) and displays the Openframe logo when appropriate. It serves as the entry point for local development workflows that bridge local code with remote Kubernetes clusters.
