This file implements the development traffic interception functionality for the OpenFrame CLI, allowing developers to redirect Kubernetes service traffic to their local development environment using Telepresence.

## Key Components

- `getInterceptCmd()` - Creates the cobra command with flags for port, namespace, mount paths, environment files, and traffic filtering options
- `runIntercept()` - Main execution function that handles both interactive and flag-based intercept modes
- `runInteractiveIntercept()` - Provides an interactive flow for cluster selection, service selection, and intercept configuration
- `selectClusterForIntercept()` - Handles cluster selection using the cluster UI service
- `setKubectlContext()` - Switches kubectl context to the selected cluster

## Usage Example

```go
// Flag-based usage
flags := &models.InterceptFlags{
    Port:      8080,
    Namespace: "default",
    Mount:     "/tmp/volumes",
    EnvFile:   ".env",
}

// Interactive mode (no service name provided)
err := runIntercept(cmd, []string{}, flags)

// Direct service intercept
err := runIntercept(cmd, []string{"my-service"}, flags)

// Set kubectl context for a cluster
err := setKubectlContext(ctx, "my-cluster", true)
```

The command supports both interactive cluster/service selection and direct command-line usage with comprehensive traffic interception options including port forwarding, volume mounting, and header-based traffic filtering.
