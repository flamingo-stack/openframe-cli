Provides the `scaffold` command for deploying development environments with hot reloading capabilities using Skaffold. This command manages the complete development workflow from cluster validation to live code deployment.

## Key Components

- **`getScaffoldCmd()`** - Creates and configures the scaffold cobra command with all development-specific flags
- **`runScaffold()`** - Executes the scaffold workflow by initializing services and running the development deployment
- **`ScaffoldFlags`** - Configuration struct containing development settings like port, namespace, image, and sync directories
- **`scaffoldService.Service`** - Core service handling the scaffold workflow execution

## Usage Example

```go
// Basic scaffold deployment with interactive cluster selection
openframe dev scaffold

// Scaffold with specific cluster name
openframe dev scaffold my-dev-cluster

// Custom configuration with port and namespace
openframe dev scaffold --port 3000 --namespace dev-env

// Advanced usage with file syncing
openframe dev scaffold \
  --sync-local ./src \
  --sync-remote /app/src \
  --image my-app:dev \
  --skip-bootstrap
```

The command supports various development scenarios from basic hot reloading to advanced file synchronization between local development directories and container environments.
