Provides the scaffold command for setting up development environments with live reloading capabilities using Skaffold integration.

## Key Components

- **getScaffoldCmd()** - Returns a configured Cobra command for scaffold operations with comprehensive flag support
- **runScaffold()** - Executes the scaffold workflow by initializing services and coordinating the development environment setup
- **models.ScaffoldFlags** - Configuration structure containing port, namespace, image, sync directories, and bootstrap options
- **scaffoldService.Service** - Service layer that handles the complete scaffold workflow execution

## Usage Example

```go
// Get the scaffold command and add it to your CLI
scaffoldCmd := getScaffoldCmd()
rootCmd.AddCommand(scaffoldCmd)

// The command supports various usage patterns:
// openframe dev skaffold                    # Interactive setup
// openframe dev skaffold my-dev-cluster    # Named cluster
// openframe dev skaffold --port 8080       # Custom port
// openframe dev skaffold --sync-local ./src --sync-remote /app
```

The scaffold command streamlines development by automating cluster bootstrap, Skaffold prerequisite checks, and live reloading setup. It integrates with the executor pattern for command execution and supports both interactive and automated workflows through comprehensive flag configuration.
