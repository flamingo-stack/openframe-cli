<!-- source-hash: 819e40cb98e1a51d54bd7f86618e4ed8 -->
A command handler for the OpenFrame CLI that provides development environment scaffolding with live code reloading capabilities using Skaffold.

## Key Components

- **getScaffoldCmd()**: Creates and configures the `scaffold` command with comprehensive flags for development workflow
- **runScaffold()**: Executes the scaffold workflow by initializing services and delegating to the scaffold service
- **ScaffoldFlags**: Configuration structure supporting port mapping, namespaces, image specifications, and file synchronization

## Usage Example

```go
// Register the scaffold command with the dev command group
devCmd.AddCommand(getScaffoldCmd())

// Execute scaffold with default settings
openframe dev scaffold

// Execute with custom configuration
openframe dev scaffold my-dev-cluster --port 8080 --namespace development

// Skip cluster bootstrap and use custom values
openframe dev scaffold --skip-bootstrap --helm-values ./dev-values.yaml
```

The command supports both interactive cluster creation and explicit cluster naming, with extensive configuration options for local development ports, Kubernetes namespaces, Docker images, and file synchronization between local and remote directories. It integrates with the broader OpenFrame infrastructure while providing development-specific optimizations like disabled autosync for faster iteration cycles.
