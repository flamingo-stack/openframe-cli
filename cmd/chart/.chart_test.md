This test file validates the basic structure and configuration of the chart command in the Flamingo Stack CLI, ensuring proper command setup and help text.

## Key Components

- **TestChartRootCommand**: Main test function that validates the chart command's basic properties
- **testutil.InitializeTestMode**: Test environment setup called during package initialization
- **GetChartCmd()**: Function being tested that returns the chart command instance

## Usage Example

```go
// Running the test
go test ./chart -v

// The test validates these command properties:
cmd := GetChartCmd()
assert.Equal(t, "chart", cmd.Name())
assert.Contains(t, cmd.Short, "Manage Helm charts")
assert.NotNil(t, cmd.RunE)
```

The test ensures the chart command has proper naming, descriptions mentioning Helm chart management and lifecycle operations, and includes a valid execution function. It uses testutil for test environment initialization and follows standard Go testing patterns with testify assertions.
