This file defines the root `chart` command for the OpenFrame CLI tool, providing Helm chart management functionality with a focus on ArgoCD installation and lifecycle management.

## Key Components

- **`GetChartCmd()`** - Returns the main chart command with subcommands and configuration
- **Chart command setup** - Configures command aliases, help text, and prerequisites checking
- **Logo display logic** - Shows the OpenFrame logo contextually for subcommands
- **Prerequisites validation** - Ensures required tools are installed before chart operations
- **Subcommand integration** - Adds the install subcommand to the chart command tree

## Usage Example

```go
// Get the chart command and add it to the root CLI
chartCmd := chart.GetChartCmd()
rootCmd.AddCommand(chartCmd)

// The command supports these usage patterns:
// openframe chart           - Shows help and logo
// openframe chart install   - Installs ArgoCD chart
// openframe c install       - Using the 'c' alias
```

The command includes persistent pre-run hooks that validate prerequisites and display the OpenFrame logo appropriately. It requires an existing cluster created with `openframe cluster create` and automatically checks for required dependencies before executing chart operations.
