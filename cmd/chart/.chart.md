This file defines the main chart command for the OpenFrame CLI, providing Helm chart management functionality with a focus on ArgoCD deployment.

## Key Components

- **GetChartCmd()**: Factory function that creates and configures the root `chart` command with aliases, help text, and subcommand registration
- **PersistentPreRunE**: Hook that displays the CLI logo and ensures prerequisites are installed before executing any chart subcommands
- **RunE**: Default handler that shows the logo and displays help when the chart command is run without subcommands

## Usage Example

```go
// Create the chart command and add it to a parent command
chartCmd := GetChartCmd()
rootCmd.AddCommand(chartCmd)

// The command supports these usage patterns:
// openframe chart          // Shows help
// openframe chart install  // Runs install subcommand
// openframe c install      // Using alias
```

The command integrates with the OpenFrame ecosystem by checking prerequisites (like required tools) and displaying the application logo. It serves as a parent command that delegates actual functionality to subcommands like `install`, which are added via `getInstallCmd()`.
