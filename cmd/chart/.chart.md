This file defines the main chart command for the OpenFrame CLI, providing Helm chart management functionality with a focus on ArgoCD installation.

## Key Components

- **GetChartCmd()** - Returns the root chart command with subcommands for Helm chart management
- **PersistentPreRunE** - Handles prerequisite checking and UI logo display for subcommands
- **RunE** - Default behavior when chart command is called without subcommands
- **getInstallCmd()** - Referenced subcommand for chart installation (defined elsewhere)

## Usage Example

```go
import "github.com/flamingo-stack/openframe-cli/internal/chart"

// Get the chart command and add it to your root command
chartCmd := chart.GetChartCmd()
rootCmd.AddCommand(chartCmd)
```

The command supports:
- `openframe chart` - Shows help and logo
- `openframe chart install` - Installs ArgoCD charts
- `openframe c install` - Using the "c" alias

The command automatically checks prerequisites before execution and displays the OpenFrame logo in the terminal interface.
