This file defines the main chart command group for managing Helm charts in the OpenFrame CLI, specifically focused on ArgoCD lifecycle management.

## Key Components

- **GetChartCmd()** - Returns the root "chart" command with alias "c"
- **PersistentPreRunE** - Validates prerequisites and shows UI logo for subcommands
- **RunE** - Displays help when no subcommand is provided
- **getInstallCmd()** - Referenced subcommand for chart installation (defined elsewhere)

## Usage Example

```go
// Get the chart command group
chartCmd := GetChartCmd()

// The command supports these operations:
// openframe chart install           - Install ArgoCD on default cluster
// openframe chart install my-cluster - Install ArgoCD on specific cluster
// openframe c install               - Using alias

// Add to root command
rootCmd.AddCommand(chartCmd)
```

The command automatically checks prerequisites before execution and provides a consistent UI experience with logo display. It requires an existing cluster created with `openframe cluster create` and focuses primarily on ArgoCD chart management operations.
