Defines the main chart command for OpenFrame CLI's Helm chart management functionality, specifically for ArgoCD operations.

## Key Components

- **GetChartCmd()** - Main function that returns the configured `chart` command with subcommands
- **PersistentPreRunE** - Hook that displays the UI logo and checks/installs prerequisites for all subcommands
- **RunE** - Default handler that shows help when the chart command is run without subcommands
- **getInstallCmd()** - Referenced function that provides the chart installation subcommand

## Usage Example

```go
// Get the chart command and add it to your CLI
chartCmd := GetChartCmd()
rootCmd.AddCommand(chartCmd)

// The command supports these usage patterns:
// openframe chart              # Shows help
// openframe chart install      # Installs ArgoCD
// openframe c install          # Uses alias 'c'
```

The command includes prerequisite checking via the `prerequisites.NewInstaller()` system and integrates with the shared UI components for consistent branding across the CLI.
