This file defines the main chart command for managing Helm charts in the OpenFrame CLI, specifically focused on ArgoCD installation and management.

## Key Components

- **GetChartCmd()**: Returns the root chart command with subcommands for Helm chart management
- **Aliases**: Supports "c" as a shorthand alias
- **PersistentPreRunE**: Checks prerequisites and shows UI logo for subcommands
- **Subcommands**: Integrates install command via `getInstallCmd()`

## Usage Example

```go
// Get the chart command with all subcommands
chartCmd := GetChartCmd()

// Add to root CLI command
rootCmd.AddCommand(chartCmd)

// Command can be invoked as:
// openframe chart install
// openframe c install  // using alias
```

The command provides ArgoCD lifecycle management on existing clusters created with `openframe cluster create`. It includes prerequisite validation and consistent UI branding across all chart-related operations.
