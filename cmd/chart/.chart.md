Command factory for Helm chart management operations in the OpenFrame CLI. Creates the main `chart` command with subcommands for managing ArgoCD installations on Kubernetes clusters.

## Key Components

- **GetChartCmd()** - Factory function that creates and configures the chart command with aliases, help text, and subcommands
- **PersistentPreRunE** - Hook that displays the logo and ensures prerequisites are installed before subcommand execution
- **RunE** - Handler that shows the logo and displays help when no subcommand is provided
- **Subcommands** - Includes install command (via `getInstallCmd()`) for ArgoCD deployment

## Usage Example

```go
// Create the chart command
chartCmd := GetChartCmd()

// Add to root command
rootCmd.AddCommand(chartCmd)

// Available CLI usage:
// openframe chart install
// openframe c install my-cluster
```

The command requires an existing cluster created with `openframe cluster create` and automatically checks/installs prerequisites before execution. It provides a clean interface for ArgoCD chart lifecycle management with proper error handling and user feedback.
