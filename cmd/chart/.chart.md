This file defines the main chart command for the OpenFrame CLI, providing Helm chart management capabilities with a focus on ArgoCD installation.

## Key Components

- **`GetChartCmd()`** - Returns the root chart command with subcommands for Helm chart management
- **Prerequisites Integration** - Automatically checks and installs required dependencies before command execution
- **UI Integration** - Shows the OpenFrame logo contextually based on command usage
- **Subcommand Structure** - Includes an install subcommand (defined in `getInstallCmd()`)

## Usage Example

```go
// Register the chart command with the root CLI
rootCmd.AddCommand(chart.GetChartCmd())

// This enables these CLI commands:
// openframe chart                 - Shows help and logo
// openframe chart install         - Installs ArgoCD
// openframe c install             - Same as above (using alias)
```

The command includes comprehensive help text explaining ArgoCD management capabilities and requires an existing cluster created with `openframe cluster create`. The `PersistentPreRunE` hook ensures prerequisites are met and displays the logo appropriately for subcommands, while the main `RunE` shows help when no subcommand is specified.
