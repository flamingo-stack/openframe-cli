This file defines the main chart command for the OpenFrame CLI, providing Helm chart management functionality with a focus on ArgoCD installation.

## Key Components

- **GetChartCmd()**: Returns the root `chart` command with aliases and subcommands
- **PersistentPreRunE**: Validates prerequisites and displays UI logo for subcommands
- **RunE**: Handles the case when no subcommand is provided by showing help
- **getInstallCmd()**: Referenced subcommand for chart installation (defined elsewhere)

## Usage Example

```go
// Get the chart command and add to root CLI
chartCmd := GetChartCmd()
rootCmd.AddCommand(chartCmd)

// The command supports these CLI interactions:
// openframe chart           - Shows help with logo
// openframe chart install   - Installs ArgoCD (runs prerequisites check)
// openframe c install       - Same as above using alias

// Prerequisites are automatically checked before subcommands run
// Logo display is handled contextually based on command usage
```

The command includes built-in prerequisite checking and consistent UI branding across all chart-related operations.
