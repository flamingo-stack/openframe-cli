This file provides the main command structure for Helm chart management operations in the OpenFrame CLI, specifically focused on ArgoCD lifecycle management.

## Key Components

- **GetChartCmd()** - Returns the root `chart` command with aliases and subcommands
- **PersistentPreRunE** - Validates prerequisites and displays UI logo for subcommands
- **RunE** - Handles execution when no subcommand is provided (shows help)

## Usage Example

```go
// Get the chart command group
chartCmd := GetChartCmd()

// The command supports these usage patterns:
// openframe chart install
// openframe c install  (using alias)

// Command structure includes:
cmd := &cobra.Command{
    Use:     "chart",
    Aliases: []string{"c"},
    Short:   "Manage Helm charts",
}

// Prerequisites are automatically checked before subcommand execution
// Logo display is handled contextually (subcommands vs root command)
```

The command integrates with the OpenFrame ecosystem by checking prerequisites through the installer and providing a consistent UI experience with logo display. It serves as a parent command that delegates actual chart operations to subcommands like `install`.
