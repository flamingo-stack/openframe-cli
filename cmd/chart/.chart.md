Provides the main chart command for managing Helm charts, specifically for ArgoCD installation and lifecycle management on Kubernetes clusters.

## Key Components

- **GetChartCmd()** - Returns the root chart command with subcommands
- **PersistentPreRunE** - Validates prerequisites and shows UI logo for subcommands
- **RunE** - Handles the default behavior when no subcommand is specified
- **getInstallCmd()** - Referenced function that adds the install subcommand (defined elsewhere)

## Usage Example

```go
// Add the chart command to your CLI application
rootCmd := &cobra.Command{Use: "openframe"}
rootCmd.AddCommand(GetChartCmd())

// The chart command supports these operations:
// openframe chart install           # Install ArgoCD on default cluster
// openframe chart install my-cluster  # Install on specific cluster
// openframe c install               # Using alias 'c'
```

The command includes built-in prerequisite checking, UI branding with logo display, and integrates with the broader OpenFrame CLI ecosystem. It requires an existing cluster created through the cluster management commands before chart operations can be performed.
