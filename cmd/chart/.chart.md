Provides the root chart command for managing Helm charts, specifically focused on ArgoCD installation and lifecycle management.

## Key Components

- **GetChartCmd()** - Returns the main chart command with subcommands for Helm chart management
- **Prerequisites checking** - Automatically validates and installs required dependencies before chart operations
- **UI integration** - Shows OpenFrame logo and provides consistent user experience
- **Subcommand structure** - Organizes chart operations under a single parent command

## Usage Example

```go
// Get the chart command and add to root CLI
chartCmd := chart.GetChartCmd()
rootCmd.AddCommand(chartCmd)

// The command supports these operations:
// openframe chart install           - Install ArgoCD
// openframe chart install my-cluster - Install on specific cluster
// openframe c install              - Using alias
```

The command includes built-in help display when run without subcommands and performs prerequisite checks before executing any chart operations. All subcommands automatically validate required tools are installed and display the OpenFrame branding.
