This file defines the main chart management command for the OpenFrame CLI, providing ArgoCD Helm chart lifecycle operations.

## Key Components

- **GetChartCmd()** - Returns the root `chart` command with alias `c` for managing Helm charts
- **PersistentPreRunE** - Runs prerequisite checks and installs dependencies before subcommands execute
- **RunE** - Displays help when the chart command is run without subcommands
- **getInstallCmd()** - Referenced subcommand for chart installation (defined elsewhere)

## Usage Example

```go
// Get the chart command and add it to your root command
chartCmd := chart.GetChartCmd()
rootCmd.AddCommand(chartCmd)

// The command supports these CLI usages:
// openframe chart                    # Shows help
// openframe c install               # Install ArgoCD (using alias)
// openframe chart install my-cluster # Install on specific cluster
```

The command automatically displays the OpenFrame logo and performs prerequisite checks before executing subcommands. It requires an existing cluster created with `openframe cluster create` and provides a clean interface for ArgoCD chart management operations.
