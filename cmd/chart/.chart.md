This file defines the root chart command for the OpenFrame CLI, providing Helm chart management functionality with a focus on ArgoCD installation and lifecycle management.

## Key Components

- **GetChartCmd()** - Main function that returns the configured chart command with subcommands
- **Prerequisites integration** - Automatic prerequisite checking and installation via `PersistentPreRunE`
- **UI integration** - Context-aware logo display for better user experience
- **Command structure** - Root command with aliases and subcommand support

## Usage Example

```go
// Get the chart command and add it to the root CLI
chartCmd := chart.GetChartCmd()
rootCmd.AddCommand(chartCmd)

// The command provides these CLI interactions:
// openframe chart           # Shows help with logo
// openframe chart install   # Installs ArgoCD (calls subcommand)
// openframe c install       # Same as above using alias
```

The command automatically handles prerequisite validation before executing any subcommands and provides consistent branding through logo display. It serves as the entry point for all chart-related operations in the OpenFrame ecosystem, currently focusing on ArgoCD deployment to existing Kubernetes clusters.
