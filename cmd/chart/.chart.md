This file defines the root `chart` command for the OpenFrame CLI, providing Helm chart management functionality with a focus on ArgoCD installation and management.

## Key Components

- **GetChartCmd()** - Returns the main chart command with subcommands
- **Prerequisites Integration** - Automatically checks and installs required dependencies
- **UI Integration** - Shows the OpenFrame logo for better user experience
- **Command Structure** - Supports aliases (`c`) and includes help text with examples

## Usage Example

```go
// Create the chart command with subcommands
chartCmd := GetChartCmd()

// The command supports both full and alias usage:
// openframe chart install
// openframe c install

// When run without subcommands, shows help:
// openframe chart

// Prerequisites are automatically checked before subcommand execution
```

The command implements a `PersistentPreRunE` hook that validates prerequisites for all subcommands and displays the UI logo. When invoked without subcommands, it shows the help text. The command structure suggests it's part of a larger CLI tool for managing Kubernetes clusters and ArgoCD deployments.
