This file provides the main chart command for the OpenFrame CLI, enabling Helm chart management with a focus on ArgoCD lifecycle operations.

## Key Components

- **GetChartCmd()**: Returns the root `chart` command with aliases and subcommands
- **PersistentPreRunE**: Executes prerequisite checks and installations before subcommands
- **RunE**: Displays help when the chart command is run without subcommands
- **getInstallCmd()**: Referenced subcommand for chart installation (defined elsewhere)

## Usage Example

```go
// Get the chart command for CLI registration
chartCmd := GetChartCmd()

// The command supports these CLI patterns:
// openframe chart install
// openframe c install
// openframe chart (shows help)

// Add to root command
rootCmd.AddCommand(chartCmd)
```

The command includes built-in prerequisite checking via the `prerequisites.NewInstaller()` and displays the OpenFrame logo contextually. It's designed as a command group that requires an existing cluster and focuses on ArgoCD management workflows.
