This file defines the main chart command for managing Helm charts in the OpenFrame CLI, specifically focused on ArgoCD lifecycle management.

## Key Components

- **GetChartCmd()** - Returns the root chart command with alias "c" for managing Helm charts
- **PersistentPreRunE** - Executes prerequisite checks and installations for all subcommands
- **RunE** - Shows help when the chart command is run without subcommands
- **getInstallCmd()** - Referenced subcommand for installing ArgoCD (defined elsewhere)

## Usage Example

```go
// Get the chart command and add it to the root command
chartCmd := chart.GetChartCmd()
rootCmd.AddCommand(chartCmd)

// Command line usage:
// openframe chart          # Shows help with logo
// openframe c install      # Install ArgoCD (using alias)
// openframe chart install my-cluster  # Install on specific cluster
```

The command includes built-in prerequisite validation, UI logo display management, and supports both full command name and short alias "c" for convenience.
