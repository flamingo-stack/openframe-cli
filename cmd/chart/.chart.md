This file defines the main chart command for managing Helm charts, specifically focused on ArgoCD installation and lifecycle management.

## Key Components

- **`GetChartCmd()`** - Returns the root chart command with subcommands for Helm chart management
- **Command aliases** - Supports "c" as a shorthand for "chart"
- **Prerequisites checking** - Automatically verifies and installs required dependencies before execution
- **Subcommand integration** - Includes install functionality via `getInstallCmd()`

## Usage Example

```go
// Get the chart command for CLI integration
chartCmd := GetChartCmd()

// The command supports these usage patterns:
// openframe chart          - Shows help with logo
// openframe c install      - Install ArgoCD (using alias)
// openframe chart install my-cluster - Install on specific cluster

// Add to root command
rootCmd.AddCommand(chartCmd)
```

The command includes intelligent UI behavior - showing the Openframe logo for subcommands but displaying help when called without arguments. Prerequisites are automatically checked before any chart operations execute, ensuring required tools are available.
