A Cobra command factory that creates the main `chart` command for managing Helm charts, specifically focused on ArgoCD installation and lifecycle management.

## Key Components

- **GetChartCmd()** - Factory function that returns the root chart command with subcommands
- **PersistentPreRunE** - Hook that validates prerequisites and displays UI logo for subcommands
- **RunE** - Default handler that shows help when no subcommand is specified
- **getInstallCmd()** - Referenced subcommand for chart installation (defined elsewhere)

## Usage Example

```go
// Create the chart command and add it to your root CLI
rootCmd := &cobra.Command{Use: "openframe"}
chartCmd := chart.GetChartCmd()
rootCmd.AddCommand(chartCmd)

// The command supports these usage patterns:
// openframe chart              (shows help)
// openframe chart install      (installs ArgoCD)
// openframe c install          (using alias)
```

The command includes built-in prerequisite checking via the `prerequisites.NewInstaller()` and provides a consistent UI experience with logo display. It serves as the entry point for all chart-related operations in the OpenFrame CLI, with ArgoCD being the primary managed chart.
