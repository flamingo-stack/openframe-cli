This file defines the main `chart` command for the OpenFrame CLI, providing Helm chart management capabilities with a focus on ArgoCD installation.

## Key Components

- **GetChartCmd()**: Returns the root chart command with aliases and subcommands
- **PersistentPreRunE**: Handles UI display and prerequisite checks for all subcommands
- **RunE**: Shows help when the chart command is run without subcommands
- **getInstallCmd()**: Referenced subcommand for chart installation (defined elsewhere)

## Usage Example

```go
// Get the chart command and add it to your CLI
chartCmd := GetChartCmd()
rootCmd.AddCommand(chartCmd)

// The command supports these usage patterns:
// openframe chart              - Shows help
// openframe chart install      - Installs ArgoCD
// openframe c install          - Using alias
```

The command automatically checks prerequisites before execution and displays the OpenFrame logo in appropriate contexts. It requires an existing cluster created with the cluster management commands.
