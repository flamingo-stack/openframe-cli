This file provides the main chart command for the OpenFrame CLI, enabling Helm chart management with a focus on ArgoCD lifecycle operations.

## Key Components

- **`GetChartCmd()`** - Returns the root chart command with subcommands for Helm chart management
- **Chart command** - Main command with alias "c" for managing Helm charts, specifically ArgoCD
- **Prerequisites integration** - Automatically checks and installs required dependencies before execution
- **UI integration** - Displays logo contextually for better user experience

## Usage Example

```go
// Get the chart command and add it to your CLI
chartCmd := GetChartCmd()
rootCmd.AddCommand(chartCmd)

// The command supports these usage patterns:
// openframe chart           (shows help with logo)
// openframe chart install   (installs ArgoCD)
// openframe c install       (using alias)
```

The command includes persistent pre-run hooks that ensure prerequisites are met and provides consistent UI branding across all chart-related operations. It requires an existing cluster created with `openframe cluster create` before chart operations can be performed.
