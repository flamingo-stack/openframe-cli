A Cobra CLI command module that provides Helm chart management functionality, specifically for ArgoCD installation and lifecycle management within the OpenFrame platform.

## Key Components

- **GetChartCmd()** - Main function that creates and configures the chart command with subcommands
- **Command Structure** - Defines the "chart" command with alias "c" for managing Helm charts
- **Prerequisites Integration** - Automatic prerequisite checking and installation before command execution
- **Subcommand Support** - Adds install subcommand for chart operations

## Usage Example

```go
// Get the chart command for CLI registration
chartCmd := GetChartCmd()

// The command supports these CLI patterns:
// openframe chart              (shows help)
// openframe chart install      (installs ArgoCD)
// openframe c install          (using alias)
```

The command implements a persistent pre-run hook that:
- Displays the OpenFrame logo for subcommands
- Checks and installs required prerequisites automatically
- Shows help when called without subcommands

This module serves as the entry point for all chart-related operations in the OpenFrame CLI, with built-in validation and user experience enhancements through the UI package.
