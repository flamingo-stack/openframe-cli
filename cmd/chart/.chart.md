This file defines the root command for Helm chart management functionality in the OpenFrame CLI, specifically focused on ArgoCD chart operations.

## Key Components

- **`GetChartCmd()`** - Returns the main "chart" command with alias "c" for managing Helm charts
- **Prerequisites check** - Automatically verifies and installs required dependencies before chart operations
- **Subcommand structure** - Integrates with install subcommand via `getInstallCmd()`
- **UI integration** - Shows OpenFrame logo for better user experience

## Usage Example

```go
// Get the chart command for CLI registration
chartCmd := GetChartCmd()

// The command supports these operations:
// openframe chart install
// openframe c install my-cluster

// Command structure includes:
// - Persistent pre-run hook for prerequisites
// - Help display when no subcommand provided  
// - Automatic logo display for subcommands
```

The command serves as a parent for chart-related operations, with built-in validation that ensures required tools are installed before executing any chart management tasks. It's designed to work with existing clusters created through the OpenFrame cluster creation workflow.
