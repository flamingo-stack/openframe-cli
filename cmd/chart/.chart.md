This file defines the main chart command for the openframe CLI, providing Helm chart management functionality with a focus on ArgoCD installation.

## Key Components

- **GetChartCmd()**: Returns the root chart command with subcommands for managing Helm charts
- **PersistentPreRunE**: Handles prerequisite checking and logo display for subcommands
- **RunE**: Shows help and logo when the chart command is run without subcommands
- **getInstallCmd()**: Referenced subcommand for chart installation (defined elsewhere)

## Usage Example

```go
// Get the chart command with all subcommands
chartCmd := GetChartCmd()

// Add to root command
rootCmd.AddCommand(chartCmd)

// The command supports these CLI patterns:
// openframe chart              # Shows help
// openframe c install          # Uses alias 'c' 
// openframe chart install      # Installs ArgoCD
```

The command includes prerequisite validation before execution and integrates with the UI package to display the application logo. It serves as a parent command that delegates actual functionality to subcommands like `install`.
