This file defines the main chart command for the OpenFrame CLI, providing Helm chart management functionality with a focus on ArgoCD installation.

## Key Components

- **GetChartCmd()**: Returns the root chart command with alias "c" and help text
- **PersistentPreRunE**: Validates prerequisites and shows UI logo for subcommands
- **RunE**: Displays help when no subcommand is provided
- **getInstallCmd()**: Referenced subcommand for chart installation (defined elsewhere)

## Usage Example

```go
// Get the chart command and add to root CLI
chartCmd := chart.GetChartCmd()
rootCmd.AddCommand(chartCmd)

// The command supports these CLI patterns:
// openframe chart           - shows help
// openframe c install       - installs ArgoCD (using alias)
// openframe chart install   - installs ArgoCD on default cluster
// openframe chart install my-cluster  - installs on specific cluster
```

The command automatically checks prerequisites before execution and provides a consistent UI experience with logo display. It requires an existing cluster created through the CLI's cluster management commands.
