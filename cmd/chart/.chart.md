This file defines the root chart command for the OpenFrame CLI, providing Helm chart management functionality with a focus on ArgoCD installation.

## Key Components

- **GetChartCmd()**: Factory function that creates and configures the main "chart" command
- **Command Configuration**: Sets up aliases, help text, and command hierarchy
- **Prerequisites Handler**: Automatically checks and installs required dependencies before subcommand execution
- **Subcommand Integration**: Adds the install subcommand to the chart command group

## Usage Example

```go
// Get the chart command and add it to your CLI
chartCmd := GetChartCmd()
rootCmd.AddCommand(chartCmd)

// The command supports these CLI interactions:
// openframe chart           # Shows help and logo
// openframe c install       # Uses alias, runs install subcommand
// openframe chart install   # Full command, installs ArgoCD
```

The command includes intelligent UI behavior - displaying the OpenFrame logo when showing help or running subcommands, and automatically validates prerequisites before executing any chart operations. All subcommands require an existing cluster created with the cluster management commands.
