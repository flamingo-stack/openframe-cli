Provides the main chart command for Helm chart management in the OpenFrame CLI, specifically focused on ArgoCD lifecycle operations.

## Key Components

- **GetChartCmd()** - Returns the root `chart` command with aliases and subcommands
- **PersistentPreRunE** - Handles logo display and prerequisite checking for all subcommands
- **RunE** - Shows help and logo when the chart command is called without subcommands
- **getInstallCmd()** - Adds the install subcommand (defined elsewhere in the package)

## Usage Example

```go
// Get the chart command for CLI registration
chartCmd := GetChartCmd()

// The command supports these usage patterns:
// openframe chart           - Shows help with logo
// openframe chart install   - Installs ArgoCD (with logo via PersistentPreRunE)
// openframe c install       - Same as above using alias

// Command can be added to a parent cobra command
rootCmd.AddCommand(chartCmd)
```

The command includes intelligent logo display logic - showing the OpenFrame logo for subcommands but displaying help when called without arguments. It also ensures all chart operations have required prerequisites installed before execution through the `prerequisites.NewInstaller().CheckAndInstall()` check.
