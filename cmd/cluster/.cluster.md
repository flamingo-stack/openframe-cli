This file serves as the main entry point for the cluster command group in the OpenFrame CLI, providing Kubernetes cluster management functionality.

## Key Components

- **GetClusterCmd()** - Returns the root `cluster` command with all subcommands attached
- **Cluster subcommands** - create, delete, list, status, and cleanup operations
- **Global flags initialization** - Sets up shared configuration options
- **Prerequisites checking** - Validates required dependencies before command execution
- **UI integration** - Shows OpenFrame logo and handles interactive elements

## Usage Example

```go
// Get the cluster command with all subcommands
clusterCmd := GetClusterCmd()

// The command supports various operations:
// openframe cluster create    - Interactive cluster creation
// openframe cluster delete    - Remove existing cluster
// openframe cluster list      - Show all managed clusters
// openframe cluster status    - Display cluster details
// openframe cluster cleanup   - Remove unused resources

// Root command shows help when no subcommand provided
// openframe cluster           - Shows help and logo
```

The command group focuses on K3d clusters for local development and includes persistent prerequisite checking to ensure all required tools are available before executing cluster operations.
