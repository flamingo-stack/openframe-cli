This file defines the main cluster command for the OpenFrame CLI, providing Kubernetes cluster lifecycle management capabilities with K3d support for local development.

## Key Components

- **GetClusterCmd()** - Returns the root `cluster` command with all subcommands attached
- **Subcommands** - Includes create, delete, list, status, and cleanup operations
- **Prerequisites check** - Validates required dependencies before command execution
- **Global flags** - Supports shared configuration options across all cluster commands
- **UI integration** - Shows application logo and provides consistent user experience

## Usage Example

```go
// Get the cluster command with all subcommands
clusterCmd := GetClusterCmd()

// The command supports various operations:
// openframe cluster create    - Interactive cluster creation
// openframe cluster delete    - Remove existing cluster
// openframe cluster list      - Show all managed clusters
// openframe cluster status    - Display cluster details
// openframe cluster cleanup   - Clean unused resources

// Command can also be invoked with alias:
// openframe k create
```

The command includes prerequisite checking, logo display, and help functionality when no subcommand is specified. It serves as the entry point for all cluster-related operations in the OpenFrame CLI.
