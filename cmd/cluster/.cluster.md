This file defines the main cluster command for the OpenFrame CLI, providing Kubernetes cluster management functionality through various subcommands.

## Key Components

- **GetClusterCmd()** - Main function that returns the configured cluster command with all subcommands
- **Cluster subcommands** - create, delete, list, status, and cleanup operations for K3d clusters
- **Prerequisites checking** - Validates required dependencies before command execution
- **Global flags integration** - Configures shared flags across all cluster operations

## Usage Example

```go
// Get the cluster command for CLI registration
clusterCmd := GetClusterCmd()

// The command supports various operations:
// openframe cluster create    - Interactive cluster creation
// openframe cluster delete    - Remove existing cluster
// openframe cluster list      - Show all managed clusters
// openframe cluster status    - Display cluster details
// openframe cluster cleanup   - Remove unused resources

// Command aliases are supported
// openframe k create          - Short form using 'k' alias
```

The command includes persistent pre-run hooks that display the OpenFrame logo and verify prerequisites like Docker and K3d installation. When called without subcommands, it shows help information with usage examples.
