This file defines the main cluster command for the OpenFrame CLI, providing Kubernetes cluster lifecycle management functionality with support for K3d local development clusters.

## Key Components

- **GetClusterCmd()** - Returns the root cluster command with all subcommands configured
- **Subcommands** - create, delete, list, status, and cleanup operations
- **Global flags initialization** - Sets up shared configuration options
- **Prerequisites checking** - Validates environment before command execution
- **UI integration** - Shows logo and provides consistent user experience

## Usage Example

```go
// Get the cluster command for CLI registration
clusterCmd := GetClusterCmd()

// The command supports various subcommands:
// openframe cluster create    - Interactive cluster creation
// openframe cluster delete    - Remove clusters
// openframe cluster list      - Show managed clusters  
// openframe cluster status    - Display cluster details
// openframe cluster cleanup   - Clean unused resources

// Can also use short alias:
// openframe k create
```

The command includes persistent pre-run hooks that check prerequisites and display the application logo, while the main command shows help when no subcommand is specified.
