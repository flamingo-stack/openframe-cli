This file provides the main entry point for the cluster management command group in the OpenFrame CLI, handling Kubernetes cluster lifecycle operations.

## Key Components

- **GetClusterCmd()**: Returns the root `cluster` command with all subcommands attached
- **Command aliases**: Supports `k` as shorthand for `cluster`
- **Subcommands**: create, delete, list, status, and cleanup operations
- **Prerequisites checking**: Validates system requirements before executing subcommands
- **Global flags**: Initializes and applies cluster-wide configuration options

## Usage Example

```go
// Get the cluster command group
clusterCmd := GetClusterCmd()

// Add to root command
rootCmd.AddCommand(clusterCmd)

// The command supports these operations:
// openframe cluster create    - Interactive cluster creation
// openframe k delete         - Remove cluster (using alias)
// openframe cluster list     - Show all clusters
// openframe cluster status   - Display cluster details
// openframe cluster cleanup  - Clean up unused resources
```

The command group focuses on K3d clusters for local development and includes built-in help when no subcommand is specified.
