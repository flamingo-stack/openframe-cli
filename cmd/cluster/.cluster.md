This file defines the main cluster command and its subcommands for managing Kubernetes clusters in the OpenFrame CLI tool.

## Key Components

- **`GetClusterCmd()`** - Returns the root cluster command with all subcommands attached
- **Root cluster command** - Provides cluster lifecycle management with aliases and help text
- **Subcommands** - create, delete, list, status, and cleanup operations for K3d clusters
- **Global flags initialization** - Sets up shared configuration options
- **Prerequisites checking** - Validates required dependencies before command execution

## Usage Example

```go
// Get the cluster command with all subcommands
clusterCmd := GetClusterCmd()

// The command supports various operations:
// openframe cluster create    - Interactive cluster creation
// openframe cluster delete    - Remove clusters
// openframe cluster list      - Show managed clusters  
// openframe cluster status    - Display cluster details
// openframe cluster cleanup   - Clean unused resources

// Command can be used with alias 'k'
// openframe k create
// openframe k list
```

The command includes prerequisite validation, logo display for branding, and comprehensive help text. It serves as the entry point for all cluster management operations in the OpenFrame CLI.
