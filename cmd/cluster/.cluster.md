This file defines the main cluster command for the OpenFrame CLI, providing Kubernetes cluster lifecycle management functionality through Cobra subcommands.

## Key Components

- **GetClusterCmd()** - Returns the root cluster command with all subcommands attached
- **clusterCmd** - Main Cobra command with aliases, help text, and pre-run hooks
- **Subcommands** - create, delete, list, status, and cleanup operations
- **Global flags** - Shared configuration options across all cluster commands
- **Prerequisites checking** - Validates system requirements before command execution

## Usage Example

```go
// Get the cluster command and add it to your root command
clusterCmd := GetClusterCmd()
rootCmd.AddCommand(clusterCmd)

// The command supports various operations:
// openframe cluster create    - Interactive cluster creation
// openframe k delete         - Delete cluster (using alias)
// openframe cluster list     - Show managed clusters
// openframe cluster status   - Display cluster details
// openframe cluster cleanup  - Remove unused resources

// Access with context for UI elements
ctx := context.Background()
err := clusterCmd.ExecuteContext(ctx)
```

The command includes automatic logo display, prerequisite validation, and support for K3d clusters in local development environments.
