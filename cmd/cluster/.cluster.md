Provides the main cluster command interface for managing Kubernetes clusters in the OpenFrame CLI. This is the entry point for all cluster-related operations including creation, deletion, listing, and maintenance.

## Key Components

- **`GetClusterCmd()`** - Returns the root cluster command with all subcommands attached
- **Global flags initialization** - Sets up shared configuration options across all cluster commands
- **Prerequisite checking** - Validates required dependencies before executing cluster operations
- **Subcommand orchestration** - Manages create, delete, list, status, and cleanup operations

## Usage Example

```go
// Get the cluster command for CLI registration
clusterCmd := cluster.GetClusterCmd()

// Add to root command
rootCmd.AddCommand(clusterCmd)

// The command supports aliases and provides comprehensive help
// CLI usage examples:
// openframe cluster create
// openframe k list
// openframe cluster status my-cluster
```

The command includes a persistent pre-run hook that displays the OpenFrame logo and validates prerequisites like Docker and K3d availability. It supports the alias "k" for shorter command invocation and provides detailed help text with usage examples.
