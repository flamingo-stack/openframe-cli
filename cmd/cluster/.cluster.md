This file defines the main cluster command for the OpenFrame CLI, providing Kubernetes cluster management functionality with support for K3d clusters.

## Key Components

- **`GetClusterCmd()`** - Returns the root cluster command with all subcommands attached
- **Subcommands** - create, delete, list, status, and cleanup operations
- **Global flags initialization** - Sets up shared configuration flags
- **Prerequisites checking** - Validates required dependencies before execution
- **Logo display** - Shows branding context for CLI operations

## Usage Example

```go
// Get the cluster command with all subcommands
clusterCmd := GetClusterCmd()

// The command supports various operations:
// openframe cluster create    - Interactive cluster creation
// openframe cluster delete    - Remove clusters
// openframe cluster list      - Show managed clusters  
// openframe cluster status    - Display cluster details
// openframe cluster cleanup   - Remove unused resources

// Command also has alias support:
// openframe k create          - Short form using 'k' alias
```

The command includes built-in help display when no subcommand is provided and performs prerequisite checks before executing any cluster operations. Global flags are automatically added to enable consistent configuration across all cluster subcommands.
