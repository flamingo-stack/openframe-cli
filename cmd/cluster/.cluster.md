This file defines the main cluster command for the OpenFrame CLI, providing Kubernetes cluster lifecycle management functionality.

## Key Components

- **GetClusterCmd()** - Returns the root cluster command with all subcommands and configuration
- **Cluster subcommands** - create, delete, list, status, and cleanup operations
- **Global flags initialization** - Sets up shared configuration options
- **Prerequisites checking** - Validates system requirements before command execution
- **UI integration** - Displays logo and provides consistent user experience

## Usage Example

```go
// Get the cluster command with all subcommands
clusterCmd := GetClusterCmd()

// The command supports various cluster operations:
// openframe cluster create    - Interactive cluster creation
// openframe cluster delete    - Remove clusters and resources
// openframe cluster list      - Show managed clusters
// openframe cluster status    - Display cluster details
// openframe cluster cleanup   - Remove unused resources

// Add to root command
rootCmd.AddCommand(clusterCmd)
```

The command includes aliases (short form "k"), comprehensive help text, and integrates with the OpenFrame UI system. It performs prerequisite checks before executing subcommands and supports K3d clusters for local development workflows.
