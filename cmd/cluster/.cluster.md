This file defines the main cluster command for the OpenFrame CLI, providing Kubernetes cluster management functionality through the Cobra CLI framework.

## Key Components

- **GetClusterCmd()** - Main function that returns the configured cluster command with all subcommands
- **clusterCmd** - Root cobra.Command for cluster operations with aliases and help text
- **PersistentPreRunE** - Middleware that shows logo and checks prerequisites before subcommand execution
- **Subcommands** - Integrates create, delete, list, status, and cleanup cluster operations

## Usage Example

```go
// Get the cluster command for CLI registration
clusterCmd := GetClusterCmd()

// The command supports various operations:
// openframe cluster create    - Interactive cluster creation
// openframe k list           - List clusters (using alias)
// openframe cluster status   - Show cluster details
// openframe cluster cleanup  - Remove unused resources
// openframe cluster delete   - Remove a cluster

// Register with root command
rootCmd.AddCommand(clusterCmd)
```

The command includes persistent middleware for logo display and prerequisite validation, supports K3d clusters for local development, and provides a consistent interface for all cluster lifecycle operations with global flag inheritance.
