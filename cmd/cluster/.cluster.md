Main cluster command entry point that provides Kubernetes cluster management functionality for the OpenFrame CLI tool, organizing subcommands for create, delete, list, status, and cleanup operations.

## Key Components

- **GetClusterCmd()** - Primary function that returns the configured cobra.Command for cluster management
- **Command Configuration** - Sets up the main cluster command with aliases, help text, and subcommand organization
- **Prerequisites Check** - Validates system requirements before executing cluster operations
- **Global Flags** - Initializes and applies shared configuration flags across all subcommands

## Usage Example

```go
import (
    "github.com/flamingo-stack/openframe-cli/internal/cluster"
    "github.com/spf13/cobra"
)

func main() {
    rootCmd := &cobra.Command{Use: "openframe"}
    
    // Add the cluster command to the root CLI
    clusterCmd := cluster.GetClusterCmd()
    rootCmd.AddCommand(clusterCmd)
    
    // Execute the CLI
    rootCmd.Execute()
}
```

The command supports K3d clusters for local development and provides interactive configuration. Users can access cluster functionality via `openframe cluster` or the short alias `openframe k`. Each subcommand includes prerequisite validation and consistent UI presentation with logo display.
