This file serves as the main entry point for cluster management commands in the OpenFrame CLI, providing Kubernetes cluster lifecycle operations through a Cobra command structure.

## Key Components

- **GetClusterCmd()** - Main function that creates and configures the `cluster` command with subcommands and global flags
- **Command Structure** - Sets up the root cluster command with aliases, help text, and prerequisite validation
- **Subcommand Registration** - Integrates create, delete, list, status, and cleanup operations
- **Global Flag Management** - Initializes and applies shared configuration flags across all cluster commands

## Usage Example

```go
// Get the cluster command for CLI integration
clusterCmd := GetClusterCmd()

// The command supports various operations:
// openframe cluster create    - Interactive cluster creation
// openframe cluster delete    - Remove existing clusters  
// openframe cluster list      - Show managed clusters
// openframe cluster status    - Display cluster details
// openframe cluster cleanup   - Remove unused resources

// Can also use short alias:
// openframe k create
```

The command includes automatic prerequisite checking, logo display for branding, and comprehensive help text. It focuses on K3d clusters for local development environments and provides a consistent interface for all cluster management operations.
