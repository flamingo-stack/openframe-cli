This file defines the main cluster management command for the OpenFrame CLI, providing a parent command that coordinates various Kubernetes cluster operations.

## Key Components

- **`GetClusterCmd()`** - Returns the main cluster command with all subcommands attached
- **Subcommands** - Integrates create, delete, list, status, and cleanup operations
- **Global flags** - Initializes and applies cluster-wide configuration options
- **Prerequisites check** - Validates required dependencies before command execution
- **UI integration** - Shows logo and provides consistent user experience

## Usage Example

```go
// Get the complete cluster command with all subcommands
clusterCmd := GetClusterCmd()

// Add to root command
rootCmd.AddCommand(clusterCmd)

// The command supports various operations:
// openframe cluster create    - Interactive cluster creation
// openframe cluster delete    - Remove existing clusters  
// openframe cluster list      - Show managed clusters
// openframe cluster status    - Display cluster details
// openframe cluster cleanup   - Clean unused resources
```

The command includes built-in help display when called without subcommands and performs prerequisite validation before executing any cluster operations. It supports the alias "k" for shorter command invocation.
