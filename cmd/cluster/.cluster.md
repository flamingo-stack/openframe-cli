Provides the main cluster command for Kubernetes cluster management operations within the OpenFrame CLI tool.

## Key Components

- **GetClusterCmd()**: Main factory function that creates and configures the `cluster` command with all its subcommands and global flags
- **Subcommands**: Registers create, delete, list, status, and cleanup operations for cluster lifecycle management
- **Prerequisites**: Validates system requirements before executing cluster operations
- **Global Flags**: Initializes and applies configuration flags across all cluster subcommands

## Usage Example

```go
// Get the cluster command for CLI registration
clusterCmd := GetClusterCmd()

// The command supports various operations:
// openframe cluster create    - Interactive cluster creation
// openframe cluster delete    - Remove existing clusters  
// openframe cluster list      - Show all managed clusters
// openframe cluster status    - Display cluster details
// openframe cluster cleanup   - Clean unused resources

// Can also be called with alias
// openframe k create
```

The command includes prerequisite checking, logo display for subcommands, and comprehensive help text. It focuses on K3d cluster management for local development environments and provides a consistent interface for all cluster operations through the OpenFrame CLI.
