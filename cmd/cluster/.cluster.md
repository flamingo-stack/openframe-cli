Main entry point for the cluster management command group that provides Kubernetes cluster lifecycle operations through the OpenFrame CLI.

## Key Components

- **GetClusterCmd()** - Returns the root cluster command with all subcommands attached
- **Subcommands** - Registers create, delete, list, status, and cleanup operations
- **Global flags initialization** - Sets up shared configuration options
- **Prerequisites checking** - Validates required dependencies before execution

## Usage Example

```go
// Get the cluster command for CLI registration
clusterCmd := cluster.GetClusterCmd()

// The command supports these operations:
// openframe cluster create    - Interactive cluster creation
// openframe cluster delete    - Remove existing clusters  
// openframe cluster list      - Show all managed clusters
// openframe cluster status    - Display cluster details
// openframe cluster cleanup   - Clean unused resources

// Can also be invoked with alias:
// openframe k create
```

The command includes persistent pre-run hooks that display the OpenFrame logo and verify system prerequisites (like K3d availability) before executing any cluster operations. When called without subcommands, it displays help information.
