This file defines the main cluster command for the OpenFrame CLI, providing Kubernetes cluster lifecycle management functionality through Cobra CLI framework.

## Key Components

- **GetClusterCmd()**: Main function that creates and configures the cluster command with subcommands
- **Persistent Pre-run Hook**: Validates prerequisites and shows UI logo for subcommands
- **Subcommands**: Integrates create, delete, list, status, and cleanup cluster operations
- **Global Flags**: Initializes and applies global configuration flags across all subcommands

## Usage Example

```go
// Get the complete cluster command with all subcommands
clusterCmd := GetClusterCmd()

// Add to root command
rootCmd.AddCommand(clusterCmd)

// The command provides these operations:
// openframe cluster create    - Create new K3d cluster
// openframe cluster delete    - Remove existing cluster  
// openframe cluster list      - Show all managed clusters
// openframe cluster status    - Display cluster details
// openframe cluster cleanup   - Clean unused resources
```

The command supports both the full `cluster` name and short alias `k` for convenience. Each subcommand includes prerequisite validation and consistent UI presentation through the logo display system. All operations are designed for K3d clusters optimized for local development environments.
