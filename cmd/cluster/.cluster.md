This file defines the main cluster command for the OpenFrame CLI, providing Kubernetes cluster management functionality with subcommands for creation, deletion, and monitoring.

## Key Components

- **GetClusterCmd()**: Main function that returns a configured cobra.Command for cluster management
- **Cluster subcommands**: create, delete, list, status, and cleanup operations
- **Global flags initialization**: Sets up shared configuration flags across all cluster commands
- **Prerequisites checking**: Validates required dependencies before command execution
- **UI integration**: Displays logo and provides consistent user experience

## Usage Example

```go
import "github.com/flamingo-stack/openframe-cli/internal/cluster"

// Get the cluster command with all subcommands
cmd := cluster.GetClusterCmd()

// The command supports various operations:
// openframe cluster create    - Interactive cluster creation
// openframe cluster delete    - Remove existing cluster
// openframe cluster list      - Show all managed clusters
// openframe cluster status    - Display cluster details
// openframe cluster cleanup   - Clean up unused resources

// Can also use alias
// openframe k create
```

The command includes persistent pre-run hooks that check prerequisites and display the OpenFrame logo, ensuring a consistent experience across all cluster operations. It supports K3d clusters for local Kubernetes development.
