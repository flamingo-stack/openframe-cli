This file defines the main cluster command for the OpenFrame CLI tool, providing Kubernetes cluster management functionality through Cobra command framework.

## Key Components

- **GetClusterCmd()** - Returns the root cluster command with subcommands and configuration
- **Command Configuration** - Sets up aliases, descriptions, and help text for cluster operations
- **Subcommand Registration** - Adds create, delete, list, status, and cleanup subcommands
- **Prerequisites Check** - Validates system requirements before executing subcommands
- **Global Flags** - Initializes and applies shared command-line flags

## Usage Example

```go
// Get the cluster command and add it to your root command
rootCmd := &cobra.Command{Use: "openframe"}
clusterCmd := GetClusterCmd()
rootCmd.AddCommand(clusterCmd)

// The cluster command supports these operations:
// openframe cluster create    - Create new K3d cluster
// openframe cluster delete    - Remove existing cluster
// openframe cluster list      - Show all managed clusters
// openframe cluster status    - Display cluster details
// openframe cluster cleanup   - Remove unused resources
// openframe k                 - Alias for cluster command
```

The command includes built-in prerequisite checking, logo display for branding, and comprehensive help documentation. It serves as the entry point for all Kubernetes cluster lifecycle management operations in the OpenFrame CLI.
