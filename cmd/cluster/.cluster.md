Defines the root cluster command for Kubernetes cluster management operations in the OpenFrame CLI tool.

## Key Components

- **`GetClusterCmd()`** - Main factory function that returns the configured cluster command with subcommands
- **Subcommands** - Includes create, delete, list, status, and cleanup operations
- **Global flags initialization** - Sets up shared configuration flags across all cluster operations
- **Prerequisites checking** - Validates system requirements before executing cluster commands

## Usage Example

```go
// Get the cluster command with all subcommands
clusterCmd := GetClusterCmd()

// Add to root CLI command
rootCmd.AddCommand(clusterCmd)

// The command supports these operations:
// openframe cluster create    - Interactive cluster creation
// openframe cluster delete    - Remove existing cluster
// openframe cluster list      - Show managed clusters
// openframe cluster status    - Display cluster details
// openframe cluster cleanup   - Clean up unused resources
```

The command includes automatic logo display, prerequisite validation, and supports the alias `k` for shorter commands. It's specifically designed for K3d cluster management in local development environments.
