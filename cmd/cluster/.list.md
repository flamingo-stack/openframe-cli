A Cobra CLI command implementation for listing Kubernetes clusters managed by the OpenFrame CLI tool.

## Key Components

- **`getListCmd()`** - Creates and configures the `cluster list` Cobra command with proper flag initialization and validation
- **`runListClusters()`** - Executes the cluster listing logic by fetching clusters from the service and displaying them in a formatted table

## Usage Example

```go
// Get the list command configured with all necessary flags and validation
listCmd := getListCmd()

// The command can be executed via CLI:
// openframe cluster list
// openframe cluster list --verbose
// openframe cluster list --quiet

// Or programmatically executed
err := listCmd.Execute()
if err != nil {
    log.Fatal(err)
}
```

The command integrates with the global flag system for consistent configuration handling across all cluster commands. It validates flags during the PreRunE phase and uses the command service pattern to separate business logic from CLI concerns. The output format is controlled by quiet and verbose flags, displaying cluster information including name, type, status, and node count from all registered providers.
