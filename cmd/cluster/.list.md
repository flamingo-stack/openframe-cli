This file implements the `list` subcommand for the OpenFrame CLI cluster management functionality, providing a way to display all Kubernetes clusters managed by the CLI tool.

## Key Components

- **`getListCmd()`** - Creates and configures the Cobra command for listing clusters with proper flag initialization and validation
- **`runListClusters()`** - Executes the cluster listing logic by retrieving clusters from the service and displaying them in a formatted table
- **Global flag integration** - Leverages the shared flag system for consistent behavior across commands (verbose, quiet modes)
- **Command validation** - Includes pre-run validation to ensure all flags are properly configured before execution

## Usage Example

```go
// Register the list command with the cluster command group
clusterCmd.AddCommand(getListCmd())

// The command supports various output modes:
// openframe cluster list                 # Standard output
// openframe cluster list --verbose       # Detailed information  
// openframe cluster list --quiet         # Minimal output
```

The command integrates with the OpenFrame CLI's global flag system to provide consistent verbose and quiet output modes. It retrieves cluster information from all registered providers and displays details like cluster name, type, status, and node count in a user-friendly table format. The implementation follows the CLI's standard pattern of command wrapping for common setup and error handling.
