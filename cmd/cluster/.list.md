This file implements the cluster list command for the OpenFrame CLI, providing functionality to display all Kubernetes clusters managed by the platform.

## Key Components

- **`getListCmd()`**: Creates and configures the Cobra command for listing clusters, including flag initialization, validation, and command setup
- **`runListClusters()`**: Executes the cluster listing operation by retrieving clusters from the service and displaying them in a formatted table
- **Global flags integration**: Leverages shared utility functions for consistent flag handling across commands
- **Validation pipeline**: Implements pre-run validation for both global and list-specific flags

## Usage Example

```go
// Basic cluster listing
openframe cluster list

// With verbose output showing additional details
openframe cluster list --verbose

// Quiet mode showing minimal information
openframe cluster list --quiet
```

The command retrieves cluster information from all registered providers and displays it in a formatted table showing cluster name, type, status, and node count. The output format can be controlled using the `--verbose` flag for detailed information or `--quiet` flag for minimal output. All clusters are fetched through the command service which handles provider abstraction and data formatting.
