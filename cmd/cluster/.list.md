This file implements the "list" subcommand for the OpenFrame CLI cluster management functionality, allowing users to display all managed Kubernetes clusters in a formatted table.

## Key Components

- **`getListCmd()`** - Creates and configures the `cobra.Command` for the list subcommand with flags, validation, and help text
- **`runListClusters()`** - Core execution function that retrieves clusters from the service and displays them using configured output options

## Usage Example

```go
// The command is typically registered with the parent cluster command
clusterCmd.AddCommand(getListCmd())

// Users can then run various list operations:
// openframe cluster list
// openframe cluster list --verbose  
// openframe cluster list --quiet
```

The command integrates with the global flag system for verbose/quiet output modes and includes comprehensive validation through `PreRunE`. It leverages the command service pattern to abstract cluster retrieval and display logic, supporting multiple cluster providers and output formats.
