This file implements the `list` subcommand for the cluster management functionality, allowing users to display all Kubernetes clusters managed by OpenFrame CLI.

## Key Components

- **`getListCmd()`** - Creates and configures the cobra command for listing clusters with flags, validation, and help text
- **`runListClusters()`** - Executes the cluster listing logic by fetching clusters from the service and displaying them in a formatted table

## Usage Example

```go
// Create the list command
listCmd := getListCmd()

// The command supports various flags and can be used as:
// openframe cluster list
// openframe cluster list --verbose  
// openframe cluster list --quiet

// Example integration in a parent command
clusterCmd.AddCommand(getListCmd())
```

The command integrates with the global flag system for consistent behavior across the CLI, performs pre-run validation, and delegates the actual cluster retrieval and display to the command service. It displays cluster information including name, type, status, and node count from all registered providers.
