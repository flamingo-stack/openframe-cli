Implements cluster deletion functionality for the openframe CLI, providing both interactive and direct cluster deletion with proper resource cleanup.

## Key Components

- **`getDeleteCmd()`** - Creates the Cobra command with validation and flag setup
- **`runDeleteCluster()`** - Main execution logic for cluster deletion workflow
- **Interactive UI** - Handles cluster selection with confirmation prompts
- **Service Integration** - Coordinates with cluster service for actual deletion operations

## Usage Example

```go
// Register the delete command with the parent cluster command
clusterCmd.AddCommand(getDeleteCmd())

// Command line usage examples:
// openframe cluster delete my-cluster
// openframe cluster delete my-cluster --force
// openframe cluster delete  # interactive selection

// The command workflow:
// 1. Lists available clusters
// 2. Prompts for cluster selection if not provided
// 3. Detects cluster type (kind, minikube, etc.)
// 4. Confirms deletion (unless --force flag is used)
// 5. Executes deletion with resource cleanup
// 6. Shows operation status and results
```

The command supports both direct cluster name specification and interactive selection from available clusters. It includes proper error handling, operation status display, and integrates with the global flag system for consistent CLI behavior.
