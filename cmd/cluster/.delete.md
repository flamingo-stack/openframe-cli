Handles deletion of Kubernetes clusters through an interactive command-line interface with confirmation prompts and cleanup operations.

## Key Components

- **`getDeleteCmd()`** - Creates the Cobra command definition with flags, validation, and help text
- **`runDeleteCluster()`** - Main execution logic for cluster deletion with interactive selection and error handling

## Usage Example

```go
// Create delete command
deleteCmd := getDeleteCmd()

// Execute with cluster name
args := []string{"my-cluster"}
err := runDeleteCluster(deleteCmd, args)
if err != nil {
    log.Fatal(err)
}

// Execute with interactive selection
args := []string{}
err = runDeleteCluster(deleteCmd, args)
```

The command supports both direct cluster specification and interactive selection from available clusters. It performs comprehensive cleanup including stopping intercepts, removing Docker resources, and cleaning up cluster configuration. The `--force` flag bypasses confirmation prompts for automated workflows.
