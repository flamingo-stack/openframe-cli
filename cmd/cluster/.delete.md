This file implements the `delete` command for managing Kubernetes clusters in the OpenFrame CLI, providing cluster deletion functionality with confirmation prompts and resource cleanup.

## Key Components

- **`getDeleteCmd()`** - Creates the cobra command definition for cluster deletion with proper flag validation and help text
- **`runDeleteCluster()`** - Main execution function that handles cluster selection, type detection, and deletion workflow
- **Global flags integration** - Uses shared flag management system for consistent behavior across commands
- **Interactive UI** - Leverages operations UI for user-friendly cluster selection and confirmation prompts
- **Error handling** - Comprehensive error management with verbose output options

## Usage Example

```go
// Create delete command (typically called during CLI initialization)
deleteCmd := getDeleteCmd()

// Command supports multiple usage patterns:
// 1. Direct cluster name specification
// openframe cluster delete my-cluster

// 2. Interactive selection from available clusters  
// openframe cluster delete

// 3. Force deletion without confirmation
// openframe cluster delete my-cluster --force

// The command workflow:
// 1. Lists all available clusters
// 2. Prompts user to select cluster (if not specified)
// 3. Shows confirmation dialog (unless --force used)
// 4. Detects cluster type for proper cleanup
// 5. Executes deletion and resource cleanup
// 6. Displays success/error messages
```

The command integrates with the broader cluster management system, providing safe cluster deletion with proper validation, user confirmation, and comprehensive cleanup of associated Docker resources and configurations.
