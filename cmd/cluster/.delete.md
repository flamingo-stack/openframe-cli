Implements the cluster deletion command for the OpenFrame CLI tool. Provides an interactive interface for selecting and deleting Kubernetes clusters with proper resource cleanup.

## Key Components

- **`getDeleteCmd()`** - Creates and configures the cobra command for cluster deletion
- **`runDeleteCluster()`** - Main execution function that handles cluster selection, validation, and deletion workflow
- **Interactive cluster selection** - Uses UI components for user-friendly cluster selection and confirmation
- **Cluster type detection** - Automatically detects cluster type before deletion
- **Resource cleanup** - Stops intercepts, removes Docker resources, and cleans cluster configuration

## Usage Example

```go
// Create the delete command
deleteCmd := getDeleteCmd()

// Command usage patterns:
// openframe cluster delete my-cluster
// openframe cluster delete my-cluster --force
// openframe cluster delete  # interactive selection

// The command supports:
// - Named cluster deletion
// - Interactive cluster selection from available clusters
// - Force deletion without confirmation prompts
// - Automatic cleanup of all associated resources
```

The command integrates with the service layer for actual deletion operations and provides user-friendly error handling and progress feedback through the operations UI.
