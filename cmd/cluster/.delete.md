Provides cluster deletion functionality for the OpenFrame CLI, handling cluster selection, validation, and cleanup of associated resources.

## Key Components

- **`getDeleteCmd()`** - Returns a configured Cobra command for cluster deletion with proper flag initialization and validation
- **`runDeleteCluster()`** - Main execution function that handles cluster selection, type detection, and deletion orchestration
- **Command Structure** - Supports both interactive cluster selection and direct cluster name specification via arguments
- **Flag Integration** - Integrates with global flags system including `--force` option for non-interactive deletion

## Usage Example

```go
// Command usage patterns
// Interactive selection with confirmation
openframe cluster delete

// Delete specific cluster
openframe cluster delete my-cluster

// Force delete without confirmation
openframe cluster delete my-cluster --force

// The command internally:
// 1. Lists available clusters
// 2. Handles cluster selection (interactive or from args)
// 3. Detects cluster type
// 4. Executes deletion through service layer
// 5. Provides user-friendly status messages
```

The command includes comprehensive error handling, user confirmation flows, and cleanup of Docker resources and cluster configurations. It leverages the UI layer for user interaction and the service layer for actual cluster operations.
