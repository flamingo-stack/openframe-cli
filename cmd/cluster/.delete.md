Provides the `delete` subcommand for removing Kubernetes clusters and cleaning up associated resources. Handles interactive cluster selection, validates deletion flags, and manages the complete cleanup process including Docker resources and configuration.

## Key Components

- **getDeleteCmd()** - Creates and configures the cobra command for cluster deletion with proper flag initialization
- **runDeleteCluster()** - Main execution function that handles cluster selection, type detection, and deletion workflow
- **Interactive Selection** - Uses UI components for user-friendly cluster selection and confirmation prompts
- **Cleanup Operations** - Stops intercepts, deletes clusters, and removes Docker resources and configurations

## Usage Example

```go
// Command-line usage examples:

// Delete a specific cluster by name
// openframe cluster delete my-cluster

// Force delete without confirmation
// openframe cluster delete my-cluster --force

// Interactive selection from available clusters
// openframe cluster delete

// The command handles the complete workflow:
cmd := getDeleteCmd()
err := cmd.Execute()
if err != nil {
    // Error handling with proper cleanup
    log.Fatal(err)
}
```

The command integrates with the service layer for cluster operations and provides comprehensive error handling with verbose output options. It ensures proper cleanup of all cluster-related resources and configurations.
