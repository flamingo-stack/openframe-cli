Implements the cluster deletion command for the OpenFrame CLI tool, providing functionality to safely remove Kubernetes clusters and clean up associated resources.

## Key Components

- **`getDeleteCmd()`** - Creates and configures the `delete` cobra command with flags and validation
- **`runDeleteCluster()`** - Executes the cluster deletion workflow including selection, confirmation, and cleanup
- **Command Structure** - Supports both named cluster deletion and interactive cluster selection
- **Validation** - Pre-run validation of global flags and delete-specific configuration
- **Error Handling** - Comprehensive error handling with user-friendly messages

## Usage Example

```go
// Command usage patterns:
// Delete specific cluster by name
openframe cluster delete my-cluster

// Force delete without confirmation
openframe cluster delete my-cluster --force

// Interactive cluster selection
openframe cluster delete

// The command integrates into the cluster command structure:
clusterCmd.AddCommand(getDeleteCmd())

// Example of the deletion workflow:
func main() {
    deleteCmd := getDeleteCmd()
    deleteCmd.Execute() // Handles cluster selection, validation, and deletion
}
```

The command provides a safe deletion process with cluster detection, resource cleanup, and user confirmation unless the `--force` flag is used.
