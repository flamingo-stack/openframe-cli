Implements the cluster deletion command for the OpenFrame CLI, providing both interactive and direct cluster removal functionality with comprehensive cleanup.

## Key Components

- **`getDeleteCmd()`** - Creates and configures the `delete` subcommand with proper flag initialization and validation
- **`runDeleteCluster()`** - Executes the cluster deletion workflow including selection, type detection, and cleanup operations
- **Interactive Selection** - Uses `OperationsUI` to provide user-friendly cluster selection and confirmation prompts
- **Force Mode** - Supports `--force` flag to bypass confirmation prompts for automated workflows

## Usage Example

```go
// Command line usage examples:

// Interactive deletion with cluster selection
// $ openframe cluster delete

// Direct deletion by name
// $ openframe cluster delete my-cluster

// Force deletion without confirmation
// $ openframe cluster delete my-cluster --force

// The command provides comprehensive cleanup:
// 1. Lists available clusters
// 2. Prompts for selection (if not specified)
// 3. Detects cluster type automatically
// 4. Stops intercepts and cleans up Docker resources
// 5. Removes cluster configuration
// 6. Shows progress and success/error messages
```

The command integrates with the service layer for actual deletion operations and provides a polished user experience with clear progress indicators and error handling. It supports both interactive workflows for manual use and automated workflows with the force flag for CI/CD scenarios.
