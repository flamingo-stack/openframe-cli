A Cobra command implementation for deleting Kubernetes clusters with interactive selection and comprehensive resource cleanup.

## Key Components

- **getDeleteCmd()** - Creates and configures the `delete` cobra command with flags and validation
- **runDeleteCluster()** - Main execution function that handles cluster selection, type detection, and deletion orchestration
- **Interactive UI** - Uses `OperationsUI` for cluster selection with confirmation prompts
- **Global Flags** - Integrates with shared flag system including `--force` option
- **Error Handling** - Comprehensive error handling with user-friendly messaging

## Usage Example

```go
// Register the delete command
deleteCmd := getDeleteCmd()
rootCmd.AddCommand(deleteCmd)

// Command examples:
// openframe cluster delete my-cluster
// openframe cluster delete my-cluster --force
// openframe cluster delete  # interactive selection
```

The command supports both direct cluster naming and interactive selection from available clusters. It validates flags during pre-run, detects cluster types automatically, and provides clear feedback during the deletion process. The `--force` flag bypasses confirmation prompts for automated scenarios.
