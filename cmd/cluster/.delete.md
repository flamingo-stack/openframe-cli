This file implements the "delete" subcommand for the openframe cluster CLI, enabling users to delete Kubernetes clusters and clean up associated resources.

## Key Components

- **`getDeleteCmd()`** - Creates and configures the cobra command with flags, validation, and help text
- **`runDeleteCluster()`** - Main execution logic that handles cluster selection, deletion, and user feedback
- **Interactive cluster selection** - Uses UI components for user-friendly cluster selection and confirmation
- **Force deletion option** - Supports `--force` flag to skip confirmation prompts
- **Comprehensive cleanup** - Stops intercepts, deletes clusters, and cleans up Docker resources

## Usage Example

```go
// Register the delete command
deleteCmd := getDeleteCmd()
rootCmd.AddCommand(deleteCmd)

// Command usage examples:
// openframe cluster delete my-cluster
// openframe cluster delete my-cluster --force
// openframe cluster delete  # interactive selection
```

The command supports both direct cluster name specification and interactive selection from available clusters. It includes proper error handling, user feedback through UI operations, and integrates with the global flag system for consistent behavior across the CLI.
