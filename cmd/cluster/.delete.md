Provides a Cobra command for deleting Kubernetes clusters with interactive selection, validation, and comprehensive cleanup of associated resources including Docker containers and configuration files.

## Key Components

- **`getDeleteCmd()`** - Creates and configures the `delete` cobra command with validation, flags, and help text
- **`runDeleteCluster()`** - Executes the cluster deletion workflow including cluster selection, type detection, and cleanup operations
- **Validation Pipeline** - Uses `PreRunE` for flag validation and global flag synchronization before execution
- **Interactive UI** - Integrates with `ui.OperationsUI` for user-friendly cluster selection and progress feedback

## Usage Example

```go
// Basic cluster deletion with name
openframe cluster delete my-cluster

// Interactive deletion (prompts for cluster selection)
openframe cluster delete

// Force deletion without confirmation prompts  
openframe cluster delete my-cluster --force

// The command flow:
// 1. Lists available clusters
// 2. Prompts for selection if no name provided
// 3. Confirms deletion unless --force used
// 4. Detects cluster type (kind, k3d, etc.)
// 5. Stops intercepts and cleans up resources
// 6. Removes cluster configuration
```

The command supports both direct cluster specification via arguments and interactive selection from available clusters, with comprehensive error handling and user feedback throughout the deletion process.
