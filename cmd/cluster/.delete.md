Provides a Cobra command for deleting Kubernetes clusters with interactive selection and confirmation. Handles cluster cleanup, resource removal, and graceful error handling with user-friendly messages.

## Key Components

- **`getDeleteCmd()`** - Creates the `delete` command with validation and flag setup
- **`runDeleteCluster()`** - Main execution logic that handles cluster selection, type detection, and deletion
- Interactive cluster selection via `OperationsUI`
- Global flag validation and synchronization
- Comprehensive cleanup of cluster resources and configuration

## Usage Example

```go
// Register the delete command
deleteCmd := getDeleteCmd()
parentCmd.AddCommand(deleteCmd)

// Command line usage:
// openframe cluster delete my-cluster          # Delete specific cluster
// openframe cluster delete --force             # Skip confirmation prompts  
// openframe cluster delete                     # Interactive selection

// The command will:
// 1. List available clusters
// 2. Handle cluster selection (from args or interactive)
// 3. Detect cluster type (kind, k3d, etc.)
// 4. Execute deletion with cleanup
// 5. Show operation status with friendly UI
```

The command integrates with the cluster service layer for actual deletion operations and uses the operations UI for consistent user experience across cluster management commands.
