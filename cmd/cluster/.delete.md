Provides the cluster delete command implementation for the OpenFrame CLI, handling interactive cluster selection and cleanup of all associated resources.

## Key Components

- **`getDeleteCmd()`** - Creates and configures the cobra command for cluster deletion with flags and validation
- **`runDeleteCluster()`** - Main execution function that handles cluster selection, type detection, and deletion workflow
- **Interactive UI** - Uses `OperationsUI` for user-friendly cluster selection and operation feedback
- **Service Integration** - Leverages cluster service for listing, type detection, and deletion operations
- **Error Handling** - Comprehensive error handling with verbose output support and graceful cancellation

## Usage Example

```go
// Create the delete command
deleteCmd := getDeleteCmd()

// The command supports multiple usage patterns:
// 1. Direct cluster name specification
// openframe cluster delete my-cluster

// 2. Interactive selection from available clusters  
// openframe cluster delete

// 3. Force deletion without confirmation
// openframe cluster delete my-cluster --force

// Execute with args simulation
err := deleteCmd.RunE(deleteCmd, []string{"my-cluster"})
if err != nil {
    log.Fatal(err)
}
```

The delete command provides a complete cluster cleanup workflow including stopping intercepts, removing Docker resources, and cleaning up configuration files. It supports both direct cluster specification and interactive selection with confirmation prompts for safe operation.
