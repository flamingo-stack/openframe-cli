Implements the Kubernetes cluster deletion command for the OpenFrame CLI tool. Provides interactive cluster selection, validation, and complete resource cleanup including Docker resources and cluster configurations.

## Key Components

- **`getDeleteCmd()`** - Returns a configured `*cobra.Command` for the delete subcommand with flags and validation
- **`runDeleteCluster()`** - Main execution function that handles cluster selection, type detection, and deletion workflow
- **Command flags** - Supports `--force` flag for non-interactive deletion and cluster name argument
- **Interactive UI** - Uses operations UI for user-friendly cluster selection and confirmation prompts

## Usage Example

```go
// Basic cluster deletion with interactive selection
deleteCmd := getDeleteCmd()
deleteCmd.Execute() // Prompts user to select from available clusters

// Delete specific cluster with confirmation
args := []string{"my-cluster"}
runDeleteCluster(deleteCmd, args)

// Force delete without confirmation
deleteCmd.Flags().Set("force", "true")
runDeleteCluster(deleteCmd, []string{"my-cluster"})

// Command line usage examples:
// openframe cluster delete my-cluster
// openframe cluster delete my-cluster --force
// openframe cluster delete  # interactive selection
```

The command performs comprehensive cleanup by stopping intercepts, deleting the cluster, cleaning Docker resources, and removing cluster configuration files.
