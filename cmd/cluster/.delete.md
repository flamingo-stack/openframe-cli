Provides the `delete` subcommand for the Flamingo OpenFrame CLI cluster management functionality. This command safely deletes Kubernetes clusters with interactive selection and comprehensive cleanup of associated resources.

## Key Components

- **`getDeleteCmd()`** - Creates and configures the delete subcommand with flags and validation
- **`runDeleteCluster()`** - Main execution logic handling cluster selection, type detection, and deletion
- **Interactive UI Integration** - Uses `OperationsUI` for user-friendly cluster selection and progress feedback
- **Comprehensive Cleanup** - Stops intercepts, deletes clusters, cleans Docker resources, and removes configurations
- **Force Flag Support** - Allows bypassing confirmation prompts for automated workflows

## Usage Example

```go
// Basic cluster deletion with interactive selection
func main() {
    deleteCmd := getDeleteCmd()
    deleteCmd.Execute() // User selects from available clusters
}

// Direct cluster deletion
// $ openframe cluster delete my-cluster

// Force deletion without confirmation
// $ openframe cluster delete my-cluster --force

// Interactive selection when no name provided
// $ openframe cluster delete
```

The command integrates with the global flag system for consistent behavior across all cluster operations and includes proper error handling with verbose output support.
