Implements the Kubernetes cluster deletion command for the OpenFrame CLI tool. Provides interactive cluster selection with confirmation and handles cleanup of all associated resources including Docker containers and configuration files.

## Key Components

- **`getDeleteCmd()`** - Creates the cobra command with flag validation and setup
- **`runDeleteCluster()`** - Main execution logic for cluster deletion operations
- **Interactive UI** - Uses `OperationsUI` for user-friendly cluster selection and confirmation
- **Force deletion** - Supports `--force` flag to skip confirmation prompts
- **Resource cleanup** - Stops intercepts, removes Docker resources, and cleans configuration

## Usage Example

```go
// Basic cluster deletion with interactive selection
openframe cluster delete

// Delete specific cluster with confirmation
openframe cluster delete my-cluster

// Force delete without prompts
openframe cluster delete my-cluster --force

// The command handles:
// - Listing available clusters
// - Interactive selection if no name provided
// - Confirmation prompts (unless --force used)
// - Complete resource cleanup
```

The command integrates with the service layer for cluster operations and provides comprehensive error handling with user-friendly messages throughout the deletion process.
