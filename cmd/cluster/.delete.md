Provides the `delete` subcommand for the OpenFrame CLI cluster management functionality, enabling users to delete Kubernetes clusters with interactive selection and confirmation.

## Key Components

- **`getDeleteCmd()`** - Creates and configures the cobra command for cluster deletion with flags and validation
- **`runDeleteCluster()`** - Main execution function that handles cluster selection, type detection, and deletion workflow
- **Interactive UI integration** - Uses `OperationsUI` for user-friendly cluster selection and operation feedback
- **Force deletion support** - Includes `--force` flag to bypass confirmation prompts

## Usage Example

```go
// Command usage from CLI
// openframe cluster delete my-cluster
// openframe cluster delete my-cluster --force
// openframe cluster delete  // interactive selection

// The command internally:
// 1. Lists available clusters
// 2. Prompts for selection if no cluster name provided
// 3. Confirms deletion unless --force flag is used
// 4. Detects cluster type and deletes through service layer

cmd := getDeleteCmd()
err := cmd.Execute()
if err != nil {
    log.Fatal(err)
}
```

The command provides comprehensive cluster deletion with cleanup of associated resources, Docker containers, and configuration files. It includes proper error handling and user-friendly feedback throughout the deletion process.
