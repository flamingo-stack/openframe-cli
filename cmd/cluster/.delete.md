Implements the `delete` subcommand for removing Kubernetes clusters with proper cleanup and user interaction.

## Key Components

- **`getDeleteCmd()`**: Creates and configures the cobra command for cluster deletion with flags and validation
- **`runDeleteCluster()`**: Core deletion logic that handles cluster selection, type detection, and removal execution
- **Interactive Selection**: Uses UI components to provide user-friendly cluster selection and confirmation prompts
- **Force Flag Support**: Allows bypassing confirmation prompts for automated workflows
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with user-friendly messages and verbose logging options

## Usage Example

```go
// Command usage examples:
// openframe cluster delete my-cluster
// openframe cluster delete my-cluster --force
// openframe cluster delete  # interactive selection

// The command follows this flow:
cmd := getDeleteCmd()
err := cmd.Execute() // This will:
// 1. List available clusters
// 2. Prompt user to select cluster (if not specified)
// 3. Confirm deletion (unless --force flag used)
// 4. Detect cluster type and execute deletion
// 5. Clean up associated resources
```

The command integrates with the broader cluster management system, utilizing shared services for cluster operations and providing a consistent UI experience with progress indicators and success/error messaging.
