Implements the delete command for the OpenFrame CLI cluster management, providing a comprehensive cluster deletion workflow with resource cleanup.

## Key Components

- **getDeleteCmd()** - Creates and configures the cobra command for cluster deletion with proper flag setup and validation
- **runDeleteCluster()** - Executes the deletion workflow including cluster selection, type detection, and cleanup operations
- **Cluster Selection UI** - Interactive cluster selection with confirmation prompts for safe deletion
- **Resource Cleanup** - Stops intercepts, deletes clusters, cleans Docker resources, and removes configurations

## Usage Example

```go
// Command usage patterns
// Direct cluster deletion
openframe cluster delete my-cluster

// Force deletion without confirmation
openframe cluster delete my-cluster --force

// Interactive selection from available clusters
openframe cluster delete

// The command handles:
// 1. Cluster listing and selection
// 2. Type detection (k3s, kind, etc.)
// 3. Comprehensive resource cleanup
// 4. User-friendly progress indication
```

The command integrates with the broader cluster management system, utilizing shared utilities for flag management, error handling, and service layer operations. It provides both direct cluster specification and interactive selection modes, with built-in safety confirmations unless force mode is enabled.
