This file implements the cluster deletion command for the OpenFrame CLI, providing functionality to safely delete Kubernetes clusters and clean up associated resources.

## Key Components

- **`getDeleteCmd()`** - Creates the Cobra command for cluster deletion with proper flag initialization and validation
- **`runDeleteCluster()`** - Main execution function that handles cluster selection, type detection, and deletion workflow
- **Interactive cluster selection** - Uses UI components for user-friendly cluster selection and confirmation
- **Comprehensive cleanup** - Stops intercepts, deletes clusters, and cleans up Docker resources

## Usage Example

```go
// Create the delete command
deleteCmd := getDeleteCmd()

// Add to parent cluster command
clusterCmd.AddCommand(deleteCmd)

// Command supports various usage patterns:
// openframe cluster delete my-cluster
// openframe cluster delete my-cluster --force
// openframe cluster delete  // interactive selection
```

The command includes validation, error handling, and user-friendly operations UI for a smooth deletion experience. It integrates with the service layer to handle different cluster types and ensures proper resource cleanup.
