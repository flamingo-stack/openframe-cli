Implements the `delete` command for removing Kubernetes clusters and cleaning up associated resources through the OpenFrame CLI.

## Key Components

- **`getDeleteCmd()`** - Creates and configures the cobra command for cluster deletion with proper flags and validation
- **`runDeleteCluster()`** - Main execution logic that handles cluster selection, type detection, and deletion workflow
- **Interactive Selection** - Uses UI components to provide user-friendly cluster selection and confirmation prompts
- **Resource Cleanup** - Integrates with service layer to stop intercepts, remove Docker resources, and clean configurations

## Usage Example

```go
// Create the delete command
deleteCmd := getDeleteCmd()

// The command supports multiple usage patterns:
// 1. Direct cluster name specification
// openframe cluster delete my-cluster

// 2. Interactive selection from available clusters  
// openframe cluster delete

// 3. Force deletion without confirmation prompts
// openframe cluster delete my-cluster --force

// Command execution flow:
// - Validates global flags and delete-specific flags
// - Lists available clusters for selection
// - Detects cluster type (kind, k3d, etc.)
// - Performs cleanup through service layer
// - Shows operation progress with friendly UI messages
```

The delete command provides a safe, interactive way to remove clusters with automatic cleanup of all associated resources including Docker containers, networks, and configuration files.
