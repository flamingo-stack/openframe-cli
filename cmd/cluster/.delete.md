This file implements the Kubernetes cluster deletion command for the OpenFrame CLI tool. It provides both interactive and direct cluster deletion with proper cleanup of associated resources.

## Key Components

- **`getDeleteCmd()`** - Creates and configures the delete subcommand with flags and validation
- **`runDeleteCluster()`** - Core deletion logic that handles cluster selection, confirmation, and cleanup
- **Command validation** - Pre-run validation of global and delete-specific flags
- **Interactive UI** - User-friendly cluster selection and confirmation prompts
- **Error handling** - Comprehensive error handling with verbose output support

## Usage Example

```go
// The command can be used in several ways:

// Direct cluster deletion
// openframe cluster delete my-cluster

// Force deletion without confirmation
// openframe cluster delete my-cluster --force

// Interactive selection when no cluster name provided
// openframe cluster delete

// The command integrates with the cobra CLI framework
rootCmd.AddCommand(getDeleteCmd())
```

The deletion process includes stopping intercepts, removing Docker resources, cleaning up cluster configuration, and providing user-friendly feedback throughout the operation. The command supports both force deletion and interactive confirmation modes.
