Handles deletion of Kubernetes clusters with interactive selection and comprehensive cleanup of associated resources.

## Key Components

- **`getDeleteCmd()`** - Creates the Cobra command for cluster deletion with flag validation and setup
- **`runDeleteCluster()`** - Main execution function that orchestrates cluster selection, type detection, and deletion
- **Interactive UI Integration** - Uses `OperationsUI` for user-friendly cluster selection and operation feedback
- **Service Layer Integration** - Leverages the command service for cluster listing, type detection, and deletion operations

## Usage Example

```go
// Command registration
deleteCmd := getDeleteCmd()
rootCmd.AddCommand(deleteCmd)

// CLI usage patterns:
// openframe cluster delete my-cluster
// openframe cluster delete my-cluster --force  
// openframe cluster delete  # Interactive selection

// The command handles:
// - Listing available clusters
// - Interactive cluster selection (if no name provided)
// - Cluster type detection (kind, k3s, etc.)
// - Comprehensive cleanup of Docker resources and configurations
// - User confirmation prompts (unless --force flag used)
```

The command provides comprehensive cluster deletion with safety measures including confirmation prompts, graceful error handling, and automatic cleanup of intercepts and Docker resources. It supports both direct cluster specification and interactive selection from available clusters.
