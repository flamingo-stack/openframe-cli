Implements the cluster cleanup command for the OpenFrame CLI, providing functionality to remove unused Docker images and resources from cluster nodes to free up disk space.

## Key Components

- **getCleanupCmd()** - Creates and configures the `cluster cleanup` Cobra command with flags and validation
- **runCleanupCluster()** - Core execution logic that handles cluster selection, type detection, and cleanup operations
- **GetCleanupCmdForTesting()** - Testing utility that exposes the cleanup command for unit tests

## Usage Example

The cleanup command can be used in several ways:

```go
// Basic cleanup (prompts for cluster selection)
openframe cluster cleanup

// Cleanup specific cluster
openframe cluster cleanup my-dev-cluster

// Force cleanup without confirmation
openframe cluster cleanup my-cluster --force

// Cleanup with verbose output
openframe cluster cleanup my-cluster --verbose
```

The command follows a structured workflow: validates flags, lists available clusters, presents a user-friendly selection interface, detects the cluster type (Docker, Kubernetes, etc.), and executes the cleanup operation while providing clear feedback through the operations UI. It integrates with the broader cluster management system using shared utilities for flag handling, service layer access, and user interface components.
