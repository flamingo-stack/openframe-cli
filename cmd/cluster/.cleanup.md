Implements cluster cleanup command for removing unused Docker images and resources from cluster nodes to free disk space.

## Key Components

- **`getCleanupCmd()`** - Creates and configures the cleanup command with flags and validation
- **`runCleanupCluster()`** - Main execution logic for the cleanup operation
- **`GetCleanupCmdForTesting()`** - Testing helper function that exposes the command

## Usage Example

```go
// Add cleanup command to cluster command group
clusterCmd.AddCommand(getCleanupCmd())

// The command supports various usage patterns:
// openframe cluster cleanup                    # Interactive cluster selection
// openframe cluster cleanup my-cluster        # Cleanup specific cluster
// openframe cluster cleanup my-cluster --force # Skip confirmation prompts
```

The command flows through cluster selection (with user-friendly prompts), cluster type detection, and cleanup execution with comprehensive error handling and progress feedback through the operations UI. It integrates with the global flag system for consistent behavior across the CLI.
