Implements the cluster cleanup command for the openframe CLI, removing unused Docker images and resources from cluster nodes to free disk space.

## Key Components

- **`getCleanupCmd()`** - Creates and configures the cleanup cobra command with flags and validation
- **`runCleanupCluster()`** - Main execution logic that handles cluster selection, type detection, and cleanup operations
- **`GetCleanupCmdForTesting()`** - Exported function providing command access for testing

## Usage Example

```go
// Get the cleanup command and add to parent command
cleanupCmd := getCleanupCmd()
clusterCmd.AddCommand(cleanupCmd)

// Command usage patterns:
// openframe cluster cleanup                    # Interactive cluster selection
// openframe cluster cleanup my-cluster        # Cleanup specific cluster
// openframe cluster cleanup my-cluster --force # Skip confirmation prompts
```

The command supports interactive cluster selection with confirmation prompts, handles multiple cluster types through auto-detection, and provides user-friendly operation feedback through the UI layer. It integrates with the global flag system for consistent behavior across commands.
