Provides cluster cleanup functionality to remove unused Docker images and resources from cluster nodes, helping free disk space in development environments with frequent builds.

## Key Components

- **`getCleanupCmd()`** - Creates and configures the cleanup cobra command with flags and validation
- **`runCleanupCluster()`** - Main execution function that handles cluster selection, type detection, and cleanup operation
- **`GetCleanupCmdForTesting()`** - Test-friendly export of the cleanup command

## Usage Example

```go
// Add cleanup command to parent cluster command
clusterCmd.AddCommand(getCleanupCmd())

// Execute cleanup with cluster name
// openframe cluster cleanup my-cluster

// Execute with force flag to skip confirmation
// openframe cluster cleanup my-cluster --force

// Interactive selection when no cluster name provided
// openframe cluster cleanup
```

The command supports both interactive cluster selection and direct cluster specification. It includes safety confirmations unless the `--force` flag is used, and provides user-friendly progress feedback through the operations UI. The cleanup process detects the cluster type automatically before executing the appropriate cleanup strategy.
