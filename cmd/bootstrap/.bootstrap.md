This file provides the CLI command definition for bootstrapping a complete OpenFrame environment. It serves as the entry point for the `openframe bootstrap` command, which streamlines the setup process by combining cluster creation and chart installation into a single operation.

## Key Components

**GetBootstrapCmd()** - Returns a configured Cobra command that handles the bootstrap operation with support for:
- Interactive and non-interactive modes
- Custom cluster naming
- Deployment mode selection (oss-tenant, saas-tenant, saas-shared)
- Verbose logging options
- Argument validation (maximum 1 cluster name)

## Usage Example

```go
package main

import (
    "github.com/spf13/cobra"
    "github.com/flamingo-stack/openframe-cli/cmd/bootstrap"
)

func main() {
    rootCmd := &cobra.Command{Use: "openframe"}
    
    // Add the bootstrap command to your CLI
    rootCmd.AddCommand(bootstrap.GetBootstrapCmd())
    
    rootCmd.Execute()
}
```

The command delegates the actual bootstrap logic to `bootstrap.NewService().Execute()` from the internal package, maintaining separation between CLI interface and business logic. It supports both guided interactive setup and fully automated CI/CD workflows through its comprehensive flag system.
