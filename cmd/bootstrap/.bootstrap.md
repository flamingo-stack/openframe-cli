This file provides the CLI command definition for bootstrapping a complete OpenFrame environment, combining cluster creation and chart installation into a single streamlined command.

## Key Components

- **GetBootstrapCmd()**: Returns a configured Cobra command for the bootstrap operation
- **bootstrap.NewService().Execute()**: Delegates the actual bootstrap logic to the internal service
- **Command flags**: Supports deployment mode selection, non-interactive mode, and verbose logging

## Usage Example

The bootstrap command can be used in several ways:

```go
// Get the bootstrap command and add to root command
bootstrapCmd := GetBootstrapCmd()
rootCmd.AddCommand(bootstrapCmd)
```

Command line usage examples:

```bash
# Interactive mode with prompts
openframe bootstrap

# Bootstrap with custom cluster name
openframe bootstrap my-cluster

# Non-interactive mode with specific deployment
openframe bootstrap --deployment-mode=oss-tenant --non-interactive

# Verbose mode showing ArgoCD sync progress
openframe bootstrap --verbose --deployment-mode=saas-shared
```

The command automatically runs both cluster creation and chart installation steps, providing a complete OpenFrame setup experience. It supports three deployment modes (oss-tenant, saas-tenant, saas-shared) and can operate in both interactive and non-interactive modes for CI/CD environments.
