A convenience command that provides a streamlined bootstrap process for setting up a complete OpenFrame environment by sequentially executing cluster creation and chart installation.

## Key Components

- **GetBootstrapCmd()** - Returns a configured Cobra command for bootstrapping OpenFrame environments
- **bootstrap.NewService().Execute()** - Delegates to the internal bootstrap service for actual execution logic
- **Command flags** - Supports deployment mode selection, non-interactive mode, and verbose logging

## Usage Example

```go
// Get the bootstrap command and add to root command
rootCmd := &cobra.Command{Use: "openframe"}
bootstrapCmd := GetBootstrapCmd()
rootCmd.AddCommand(bootstrapCmd)

// The command supports various execution modes:
// openframe bootstrap                                    # Interactive mode
// openframe bootstrap my-cluster                        # Custom cluster name  
// openframe bootstrap --deployment-mode=oss-tenant     # Skip deployment selection
// openframe bootstrap --non-interactive --verbose      # CI/CD mode with detailed logs
```

The bootstrap command combines cluster creation and chart installation into a single operation, equivalent to running `openframe cluster create` followed by `openframe chart install`. It provides flags for deployment mode selection (oss-tenant, saas-tenant, saas-shared), non-interactive execution, and verbose logging including ArgoCD sync progress.
