This file defines a Cobra command for bootstrapping a complete OpenFrame environment, combining cluster creation and chart installation into a single streamlined operation.

## Key Components

- **`GetBootstrapCmd()`** - Returns a configured Cobra command that orchestrates the complete OpenFrame setup process
- **Bootstrap service integration** - Delegates execution to `bootstrap.NewService().Execute()`
- **Command flags**:
  - `--deployment-mode` - Pre-selects deployment type (oss-tenant, saas-tenant, saas-shared)
  - `--non-interactive` - Skips prompts for CI/CD workflows
  - `--verbose` - Enables detailed logging including ArgoCD sync progress

## Usage Example

```go
// Get the bootstrap command and add it to root command
bootstrapCmd := GetBootstrapCmd()
rootCmd.AddCommand(bootstrapCmd)

// The command can be used in several ways:
// openframe bootstrap                                    # Interactive mode
// openframe bootstrap my-cluster                        # With custom name
// openframe bootstrap --deployment-mode=oss-tenant     # Skip deployment selection
// openframe bootstrap --non-interactive --verbose      # CI/CD mode with logs
```

The bootstrap command provides a "one-click" solution that runs both cluster creation and chart installation sequentially, making it ideal for users who want to quickly get started with OpenFrame without running separate commands.
