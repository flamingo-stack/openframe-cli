Entry point for the OpenFrame CLI application that initializes and executes the command-line interface, handling any execution errors with appropriate error messaging and exit codes.

## Key Components

- **main()**: Application entry point that executes the CLI command tree and handles errors
- **cmd.Execute()**: Delegates to the cmd package for command parsing and execution
- **Error handling**: Writes errors to stderr and exits with code 1 on failure

## Usage Example

```go
// This is typically run as a compiled binary:
// $ openframe-cli [command] [flags]

// The main function structure can be used as a template for other CLI apps:
func main() {
    if err := cmd.Execute(); err != nil {
        fmt.Fprintf(os.Stderr, "Error: %v\n", err)
        os.Exit(1)
    }
}
```

This follows the standard Go CLI application pattern where the main package serves as a thin wrapper around the actual command implementation in the `cmd` package, ensuring clean separation of concerns and proper error handling for command-line tools.
