The main entry point for the OpenFrame CLI application that handles command execution and error reporting.

## Key Components

- **main()**: Application entry point that executes CLI commands and handles errors with appropriate exit codes
- **cmd.Execute()**: Delegates command processing to the cmd package's Execute function
- **Error handling**: Writes errors to stderr and exits with status code 1 on failure

## Usage Example

This file is typically built and run as a CLI executable:

```go
// Build the CLI
go build -o openframe main.go

// The main function will:
// 1. Call cmd.Execute() to process CLI arguments
// 2. Handle any errors by printing to stderr
// 3. Exit with code 1 on error, 0 on success
```

The main function serves as a thin wrapper around the command system, ensuring proper error handling and exit codes for shell integration.
