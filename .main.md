This is the main entry point for the OpenFrame CLI application that handles command execution and error handling.

## Key Components

- **main()**: Entry function that executes CLI commands and handles any errors by printing to stderr and exiting with status code 1
- **cmd.Execute()**: Primary command execution from the cmd package that returns an error if command processing fails

## Usage Example

```go
// This file is typically run as the compiled binary
// Example command execution flow:
func main() {
    if err := cmd.Execute(); err != nil {
        fmt.Fprintf(os.Stderr, "Error: %v\n", err)
        os.Exit(1)
    }
}

// When compiled and run:
// $ go run main.go [command] [flags]
// $ ./openframe-cli [command] [flags]
```

The application follows standard Go CLI patterns by delegating command handling to a separate cmd package while maintaining clean error handling at the application level. Any command failures are properly reported to stderr with a non-zero exit code for shell script compatibility.
