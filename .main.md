Entry point for the OpenFrame CLI application that initializes and executes the command-line interface with proper error handling.

## Key Components

- **main()** - Application entry point that calls the root command executor
- **Error handling** - Captures and displays command execution errors to stderr
- **Exit codes** - Returns proper exit status (1) on command failures

## Usage Example

This file serves as the CLI entry point and is not imported directly. When built, it creates the `openframe` executable:

```go
// Build the CLI
go build -o openframe main.go

// The executable will run commands like:
// ./openframe --help
// ./openframe deploy
// ./openframe status
```

The main function delegates all CLI functionality to the `cmd` package, following the typical pattern for Go CLI applications using libraries like Cobra. Any command errors are properly formatted and sent to stderr with a non-zero exit code for scripting compatibility.
