Entry point for the OpenFrame CLI application that initializes and executes the command-line interface with proper error handling.

## Key Components

- **main()** - Application entry point that calls the command executor and handles errors
- **cmd.Execute()** - Delegates to the cmd package for command parsing and execution
- **Error handling** - Prints errors to stderr and exits with status code 1 on failure

## Usage Example

This file serves as the application bootstrap and is not typically imported. When the CLI is built and run:

```go
// Build the CLI
go build -o openframe main.go

// Run commands (examples)
./openframe --help
./openframe init my-project
./openframe deploy --environment production
```

The main function acts as a thin wrapper around the cmd package, ensuring any execution errors are properly formatted and cause the application to exit with an appropriate status code for shell scripting and CI/CD integration.
