Entry point for the OpenFrame CLI application that initializes and executes the command-line interface with error handling.

## Key Components

- **main()** - Application entry point that executes CLI commands and handles errors
- **cmd.Execute()** - Imported function that runs the CLI command framework
- Error handling with stderr output and non-zero exit codes

## Usage Example

```go
// This is typically run as a compiled binary
// $ openframe-cli [command] [flags]

// The main function handles execution flow:
func main() {
    if err := cmd.Execute(); err != nil {
        fmt.Fprintf(os.Stderr, "Error: %v\n", err)
        os.Exit(1)
    }
}
```

The application follows standard CLI patterns where successful execution exits with code 0, while errors are written to stderr and exit with code 1. All actual command logic is delegated to the `cmd` package's `Execute()` function.
